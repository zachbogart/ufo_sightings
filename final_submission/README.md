## Main Sections

The project was split into seven parts. For ease of collaboration, we split it into several Rmd files and knit them separately.

	* Introduction, Description of Data, and Analysis of Data Quality
	* Basic discussion of dataset and what the raw data looked like from the start

	* Biggest hurdle: formatting duration. Everything from "5 minutes" to "Milking Cows"

* part4_eda
	* Exploratory Data Analysis
	* Graphs, graphs, and more graphs 

* part5_ExecSummary
	* Executive Summary

All parts are available as `Rmd` and `html` files.
