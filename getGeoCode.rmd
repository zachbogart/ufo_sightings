## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)

library(ggmap)
library(geosphere)

ufos <- read_csv('/home/khalana/GitRepos/ufo_sightings/ufo_clean.csv')

ufos$citySt <- paste(ufos$City, ufos$State)
ufos$citySt <- gsub(", NA", "", ufos$citySt)

tmp <- head(ufos,60)

tmp$geocode <- lapply(tmp$citySt,  function(x) geocode(x))

map("world", "China")
map.cities(country = "China", capitals = 2)
map("state", "New Jersey")
data(us.cities)
colnames(us.cities)[1] <- "CitySt"
map.cities(us.cities, country="")



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
