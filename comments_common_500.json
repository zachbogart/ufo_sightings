["formation of lights move quickly across the night sky in hawaiiAt first we thought it was a shooting star.  Soon after we realized the entire sky full of light as we thought they were just stars starting moving pretty quickly across the sky as we were all in disbelief. We would say there was about 40 to 50 of the lights in the sky moving in a formation.  I tired to take pictures and a video but it was too faint and was not able to get anything worth anything. After about 4 to 5 minutes we could not see the lights. It was amazing none of us have ever seen of heard of anything like this. Really wish we could figure it out", "I hung up the phone with a friend and went to bed. I had pulled the covers around my shoulders and my eyes were closed. With closed eyes I noticed a bright light enter my room. I opened my eyes and the room was light (not with an exceptionally bright light, just like a lite room). The light dissapated and then through partially cosed vertical blinds, a light entered my room and circled the room. Through the verticle blinds a shadow appeared in the light in the room. The shadow had an elongated head (not long as in high, but as in a sort of football shape) a long thin neck and a thick body. I shadow didn't move with the light, but through it.  So in otherwords the light behind it was not moving, the shadow was. I thought of more rational possibilities than an extra terrestrial or alien or other life form, whatever your preference in title, but because of the angle of the blinds, I couldn't justify the way the light moved around the room instead of on one wall. Perhaps this is something to report, or perhaps I need a lesson in light movement?  I'm not ruling either possibility out. when I got the nerve up to look outside, the light had vanished and car alarms were going off. I got back into bed and heard a low level ???hum or ??? - an easier sound to make then to describe - type sound.", "half circle formed in 12 orange lights glidingi was washing my dishes in the kitchen and i seen a funny object in the sky in a shape of a half circle, it was approx 12 lights all formed in a half circle orange in colour. any explanations please ???((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

The first night, as we got nearer, the lights faded, one actually separated into two lights close together, one slightly higher than the other, and then both slowly got dimmer and disappeared.  Last night, the second night we were driving back the same way at the same time, and the lights were visible in the same place.  This time my husband and I were determined to get closer to them, so we drove down toward Bayport all the way to the river's edge, but lost them behind the trees while we were driving.

Other fast lights started coming out of the objet and zipping around back and forth.  We recorded it with our cell phone.

We live in the Killian area of Miami and our best estimate is that the craft was near or above the Miami Zoo.Our dog is very sick and throwing up and she went to open the door in front of our house so the dog can go to the bathroom.  When she looked up, in a south-westerly direction, she saw the craft at approximately a 45 degree angle.Attached is a drawing of the craft made by my wife.  It was shaped like a cylinder but with pointed edges on both sides which appeared triangular shaped on each end.   The right and left sides, inside the triangle portion of the edges, had two large bands of extremely bright multi-colored lights on each side.  The middle part of the craft appeared very light whitish or grey colored.The craft made an extremely loud noise, much more powerful than if an airplane was standing directly above us.  The object remained stationary for about 5 minutes and then it disappeared.We have attached a drawing of the object, a map showing the location of our house and the location of the Miami zoo area, and a weather chart indicating that the visibility was 10 miles, and that there were scattered clouds at 3:30 am that night.  My wife said that she saw many stars in the sky that night and thus she had excellent visibility.SUMMARY  \tPrevious to these events, my wife and I have never seen UFOS or other similar objects in our life.She is not bothered by this because she is very religious thinks that they were a messenger from God.  I, on the other hand, have been freaked out.  I started doing research on the subject, have joined MUFON, ordered about 30 UFO books, listen daily to Coast to Coast, etc, etc.  I never even knew that these radio programs or UFO organizations existed.   I am now consumed by the subject.  I need to find some answers and some closure because my wife says that I became obsessed with this issue.Finally, I am an attorney with the IRS in Miami, FL and my wife was trained as a physical therapist and is a stay-at-home mom.  We live in a very nice upper middle class neighborhood in the Killian area of Miami, Florida.  We have lead normal dull lives until recently.", "Oblong silver oval in northern sky.I have seen this same object twice, but not in the same location.

Disappearance during a quite glance at my watch to record the time since this was such an unusual event.While standing on the beach at sunup, while still able to see starts, I observed a bright light that I initially considered to be a planet, only much brighter.  Eventually the light starting moving as if an aircraft was traveling towards me and veering away.  It began to accelerate rapidly and disappeared during the time of a quick glance at my watch. There was no sound, no wind. There was a band of clouds on the horizon, although I was able to see stars above me.

I appeared to be staying in the same place or moving very slowly. I watched it stay in the apparently same location for about five or more minutes. At this point thought it was two large and very close stars. I then went into the house and told my mother to come see it. We wasn't looking at it very long and then it started to approach us. I could tell it was getting closer because the two large lights was spreading further apart and getting larger. The lights blinked off and on twice and what I thought was going to be a thrid time but instead the two lights just very went dim. Soon it was directly overhead and this is when I looked through my binoculars for a better look. My mom who was talking on the phone heard lots of static on the cordless phone. I could tell that it was triangular except the point of the triangle was the tail instead of what I believe should be the nose. The tail had a very small red light compared to the large front lights. These lights looked as tough they was pointed down at a forty five degree angle. It was flying very low and I could hear the engine. The engine sounded as though it had zero throttle. It did't sound like the planes to day but those in old war movies. As soon as it crossed over my house I went to the front porch and watched it circle over high way about 3000 yards away. Then Sept. 9, 2000 I seen two transport helicopters then about five minutes later I seen a Apache or simiular helicopter going in the direction of where the object came from. Then I remembered seeing three helichopters come off the ground and fly over me about ten minutes before the strange object on the the night of Sept. 1, 2000. The are no airports near my area which is in the country. The lights was was bigger than the moon that night. And I believe the moon was almost full that night. I am certain that is was very large and flying very low.

But, I think it was about an hour or so after lunch because the remainder of the day on my calendar is leave (I remained at the office, I just could not perform anymore duties because I was a bit shaken).  The weather was overcast and it had been raining a bit.As I was looking out of my office window (building located downtown ), I saw a flat dark, grayish object appear just above the buildings about 4 blocks N. of my office bldg.  The object was flat, with an odd sort of rectangular shape.  It definitely was not a helicopter.  It flew very close to one particular highrise, a building I usually watch because it frequently has window-washers cleaning the windows, and it is one of just a few buildings in the center of the view from my office building.At first I thougt the object was a plane.  Then I thought I was seeing things, because it did not fly by, but rather just circled the building in question.  It then hovered near the top of the building as if it were trying to survey it.  It did this long enough for me to stare for several seconds, then to get my glasses and stare for several more seconds.

The object caught my attention because it was bright and had a bright trail behind it. The descent lasted approximately one second.  The object then stopped its downward linear motion and at a 90 degree angle began going from right to left across the sky at speeds I have never seen. This motion lasted approximately 3 seconds. The object, at that time, had my full attention; therefore, I noticed a blue and red trail.  At the conclusion of the three seconds that it moved from right to left across the sky, it vanished from sight along with its trail almost instantly.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he seemed to us to be exceptionally objective and logical in his description of the event.

Two seperate craft.On December 9th 2009 at approximately 21:00 hours, I was driving southbound on Miller road approaching Southern avenue.  I noticed two bright lights to the south that appeared to be about one mile away near the old mill.  As I approached my turn at Maricopa I was still watching the lights as they were out of the ordinary.  They appeared to slowly be moving to the west as I was traveling west down Maricopa road. This is when I became alarmed.As I made the turn onto sunset point south bound, I kept fixated on the two lights hovering in the sky.  They appeared to stop moving. I raced to baseline road as quickly as possible.  When I got there I parked on the south side of baseline looking south.  The object was approximately 300 yards away hovering about 100ft in the air.  I could barely make out a dark silhouette between the lights.  They appeared to slowly begin moving south when the light on the right side of the object flickered out slowly.  The other light remained, but appeared to be dimming.  It took approximately 30 seconds to one minute before the left side or remaining light dimmed then flickered out as well.I regained my composure and began to try to rationalize the sighting.  Maybe it was something I just hadn\u2019t noticed before.  Anyway my Wendy\u2019s was getting cold, so I began to leave.   I looked back up, and the lights were back, but twice as far away as and farther east than before.  I realized I had my digital camera with me, I took video for 1min 45 seconds at this point.  The lights hovered and slowly started to move south.Throughout this entire time the object never lost altitude, and wasn\u2019t moving fast enough to achieve this by conventional means like everyday aircraft. No noise either, just silence.Video was stopped due to poor camera quality. I continued to watch for approximately a minute longer absolutely fixated. I looked away to prep the camera for more video. When I looked up there was another set of two lights. Closer together and not parallel to each other like the first lights. I took video again for 1min 45 seconds.The first set were still there, but began to flicker out just like the first time. First the right one went out quite quickly. Then the left remained illuminated, but appeared to be dimming. The newer set of lights maintained its tight formation with the first object as the remaining light from it disappeared.

At first I thought it was just the strobe from an airplane, but after watching for a few seconds,  I concluded it was not.  This light was flashing at irregular intervals and intensities, and would hoover in one spot before moving slightly and slowly to another spot.

The object would flash irregularly with varying intensities and move slowly in one direction, and then change directions, sometimes moving up, down or back to its previous spot.

I looked up, and saw it was triangular in shape, with bright white lights at each of the three corners.  There was also a slightly larger white light directly in the center.  It really caught out attention not because of its shape, but because it wasn't moving... it seemed to just hover in place for awhile.  After watching it (and the road), it picked up a tremendous amount of speed in a relatively short amount of time - heading northward.

Sometimes, they can appear stationary when they are headed straight towards you.  There were several other aircraft in other parts of the sky, all clearly moving in various directions. But this light remained stationary in relation to the moon, which was visible to the east.  I and my passengers coud see it all the way into the Washington DC area.  It seemed much too bright and large to be a star or planet, but I didn't really give it much more thought.  However, this morning, same time, same route, it was there again.  The moon was lower in the sky than it was two days ago, but the light was in the same place.  This time, I paid more attention to it.  While I waited at the commuter lot, I watched this light closely.  Ever so often, it seemed to move up, down, and side to side, very slightly, and very rapidly. I guess you'd call it a barely discernable wobble.  Coincidentally, one of the riders from two days before got in, and I called his attention to the light.  As we sat waiting for another rider, we both watched it, and he observed it wobble.  I've seen bright lights in the sky before, and never really thought much about it.

The viewers were frightened and did not attempt to get in a vehicle to drive closer for a better view.  They did, however, use binoculars in their attempt to describe the craft.  It was, as stated to me, definitely a sphere, definitely rotating, possessing colored lights around its perimeter, and it maintained a consistent altitude.The 40 year old daughter saw the craft, after nearly three hours of viewing....simply VANISH into thin air.What is the credibility of these witnesses?  All four have bachelor/masters degrees.  They are intelligent, \"sensible\", low key individuals who do not wish to be interviewed or identified.  They notified me because I share an interest in the night sky.  I can think of no family as credentialed or credible as this family.

Around 7 a.m. both lights just disappeared.  I took pictures on my phone and when you zoom in you most definitely can see the object shape and three very distinct lights on the larger of the two.  The lights appeared to be colorful; at least yellow and red or pink can't really tell.

I was on my way to my bosses house at appox. 8:00pm on Aug. 28.  (I was headed West on US 54 through Wichita.)  I noticed in the Western sky a slow-moving oblongular object that appeared to be heading South in direction.  If I had to guess I would say that it looked like a comet or shooting star in the daylight.  As I kept watching this object noticed that it stopped for an extended amount of time.  (probably 3-4 minutes)  Then all of a sudden it shot off much quicker than it had been moving before in a Northwesterly direction.", "Standing in driveway, saw a strange craft; weird altitude for airplane. It made no sound, and moved with speed of the clouds...as if hiding?I was standing in my driveway, talking on a cordless phone to a buddy in Houston, BS-ing and having a smoke, and here we go again; more odd flying objects in the sky.  I was facing the house, looking up at the more or less cloudy sky, when I spotted a weird light.  At first glance it appeared as another plane...or a star?  No, look again.  It was at a wierd altitude for a standard aircraft, and at a closer look, it sort of looked like two bright stars stuck together...but it was moving.  Object had no traditional aircraft lights,(i.e. blinkers, reds, blues), just plain white light.  What really perplexed me was the movement.  The object was gliding, moving along with the clouds; same speed and same direction.  I know it sounds dimpy, but I got the feeling that it was trying to hide.

These stars/lights were very similar to the shape of a constalation.  I noticed, however, that these lights were very close to one another not spaced out at all.  The lights were white and slightly dim, like dimmer stars, and could see about 8-10 of them.  I kept staring at the object(s). It was static and did not move for a moment.  I looked at the clock and noted that it was 12:37.  Then the object(s) started to glide slowly to the ground.  I told the driver to start driving faster because the ojects view was lost behind some trees.  As we followed it, it looked as if though either the oject was rotating from left to right or as if the light formations were moving.  I noticed at this point that it seemed a little darker than the sky. I call it an object because the lights seemed to be in sync with each other. as it slowly descended, it quickly disappeared.  And then as soon as I couldn't see it anymore, I thought to myself \" I want to see it again\"  instantly, there was a line of light overhead that was white and very thin.  similar to a shooting star, but instead just a line not a streak.  we had pulled off of the road at this point.. we waited but it didn't return.

After some delay, we made it, but the sun was close to setting.  We played a game of frisbee and ran the dogs to warm up, then my younger cousin and I decided to jump in the ocean before it got too late.  A few minutes after we had gotten settled, I saw something out of the corner of my eye.  It was a pink, circular object floating through the air, it seemed as though it were halfway between us and the mainland (we live on an island).  So- it appeared, about 40 degrees above the horizon, the craft being no more than five degrees across, went left (north) in a straight line for about five seconds and then all the sudden zigzagged back and forth (forward and back) a bit and then dropped straight into the ocean and disappeared.  As soon as it was gone, I looked to my cousin, standing five feet away from me, and asked him if he had seen it as well.  He had.  I called back to my boyfriend and other ! cousin on the shore, but neither of them had seen the event;  I don't known how he dogs reacted- we were mesmerized until it was over.  I don't believe it sped up or slowed down at all, it moved very smoothly and consistently through the sky, and just dropped straight down into the water, but at the rate it was moving across the horizon it must have been moving very quickly.", "Four, football field bright, lights over the sky of Andrews.At approximately 8:30 PM Thursday night, Myself and a co-worker witnessed four very bright lights hoovering about 20-30 feet above the tree line.  We were sitting on our music stage at work. We were facing the restaurant. I looked over my left shoulder at my buddy.  I noticed these lights. I tapped him on the shoulder and asked him what that was.  He saw it and replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I then slapped him on the shoulder and asked him again, \u201cWhat the f*** is that?!  The lights were grouped together in a kite shape.  There was one in front, one light offset to the right(just behind and to the side of the front light,) one light offset to the left(just behind and to the side of the front light,) and one light in the back( there was more space between the front and back light, than there was between the side lights.  The lights were pointing down to the ground, and you could see beams of light below these lights.  It appeared to over the trees, but was close enough to know that whatever it was, it was big.  We then stood up.  Almost as if they heard us, as soon as we stood up the lights started to dim.  I thought they were going behind the tree line.  But when I stood up, the tree line was 20-30 feet below where these lights were.  The lights dimmed to nothing, and it disappeared.. We kept our eyes on the sky.   After the lights dimmed out I could notice approx. 12 twinkling lights flying erratically in a northerly direction.  They kept moving until out of sight.  Shortly after, a small prop plane flew by, quite low.     This was the first noise we heard in the sky. The small plane flew over the area where we had spotted these lights.  He flew by and continued towards town.  We could see and hear him circle back and then he started flying towards us.  His headlights were coming right at us, then he darted back over the highway where the lights were.  This time when he got in that area he did a complete turnaround. When he turned back, my co-worker and myself saw 6 twinkling lights coming back at us from the north.  They were heading in a southerly direction.  Then all the lights disappeared, except one. It was a clear night last night. And not a whole lot of traffic in the sky, except after what we saw. For a while there, it looked like the sky was dancing. We have been trying to come up with some explanation for what we saw.  The first thing we thought was maybe it was a light tower.  But there are no light towers in the vicinity of where witnessed the lights. The lights were as bright as the ones at a football field.  They were unlike our parking lot lights, they are more reddish.  These were very bright. And then they just dimmed out, like on a dimmer switch.  No noise in the sky when the lights disappeared.Nothing like this had ever happened to us before.  We are both mind blown by what we witnessed. You can guarantee we will be out there for the next few nights.  This time I\u2019m bringing my camera in hopes of getting it on film.", "Staggered, colorful strobing lights spotted southwest of Sour Lake, Texas.Forgive the rushed nature of this sighting, I will submit a more extensive report soon. Beginning on December 11, and as recently as last night, December 13, a series of odd lights were observed to the west-southwest of our town\u2019s high school.Just above the treeline, these lights varied in number from one to six, merging with each other and splitting apart at seemingly random intervals.  At times there was only a single light, at other times up to six lights, slowly bobbing around into different patterns.  My sightings occurred on December 12 and 13, after hearing about the occurrence from a family friend who had seen them on the 11th.  The lights appear at about 5 pm to 5:15, and stay for hours, the latest I have observed was still hovering at 8:15 p.m..The lights themselves had the general appearance of large stars, but would bob around.  In a few instances, the lights multiplied into 5 or 6, and took on the shape of an obtuse angle, with one arm shorter than the other, as if a clock was reading the time 3:50.  These lights would take on seemingly intentional color schemes, with some appearing to strobe predominantly cool colors, others flashing warmer, bronze tones, and one that remained white-hot throughout.It should also be noted that over the past three nights, a large group of conventional aircraft, numbering from six to eleven, can be observed circling the area, never venturing too close to the lights.  Most appear to be airplanes, a few may be helicopters.  Apparently, both the lights and planes have been observed by citizens of the nearby town of Nome sporadically since the end of Hurricane Harvey, the devastation of which ravaged this area quite badly.  The area over which the lights seem to be hovering is seemingly inaccessible, and is most likely either rice farms of oilfields.  I plan to return tonight and every night until these lights cease.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness on two occasions, and he sounded to us to be exceptionally eloquent and sober-minded.

Also, how do you know they are \"50 miles\" away?  Lights in the night sky are very difficult to determine a range to, probably impossible, without triangulation. Thank you!((WITNESS RESPONSE))it was probably military flares.((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea what the witness observed.  The first possibility to be ruled out, we feel, would be celestial bodies.

Anyway, I was 12 years old and me and my old best friend were camping in my backyard. At around 2:00AM the sprinklers came on and woke us up. We rushed outside the tent tp put a cover over us and we had some trouble trying ro get back to sleep. Bored took control and we looked for something to do. I had a few books and we read a few of them outload for some entertainment. It was my friends turn to read and as he was reading I looked outside then tent window. I gazed into the sky it was extremely clear out. One star caught my attention. It wasnt the movement thought that caught me at first. It was how bright it was. Slightly brighter then most of the stars. It was Northeast of us and I couldnt take my eyes off it. Then I noticed movement. Extremely slow movement. If you werent staring at the star and concentrating you wouldnt of noticed it. I told my friend to take a look and he used the binocculars he brang when we went hiking earlier that night. After focusing for about 15minutes we began to hear weird noises from the back side of the wall behind my house. More than likely it was animals. So we shrugged it off and looked at the star again. After another 5minutes I lost interest and picked up the book again. Like 30 seconds later my friend kept saying \"Oh shoot, oh shoot, look!\" before I even looked all the hairs on my body were standing on end. I looked out the window and froze. A triangular like craft was hovering 20 feet from me right over my backyard wall. The lights were bring but seemed to be pointed and concentrated on a few parts of the yard. It had exactly four lights. One on each corner of the craft and one dead center.     Each angle one the craft was equivalent. You couldnt tell which angle was the from of the ship. It made no noise whatsoever it was almost like it sucked the sound out of world around us. I knew it wasnt a plain because it was PERFECTLY still and the shape was too perfect to be anytype of plane. I live on the front of the San Bernardino MTS so it was also too low to be a plane. The only available thing left to assume is a helicopter but again it was silent no noise whatsoever. This is my only explaination. Anyway, it sat there for about 3 to 4 miutes and I never spoke or took my eyes off it.In an instant it left to the distance still visible. When I mean distance i mean like half a second or less. And we watched it fly accross the sky at extreme speeds. It was one hell of an experiance. Afterwords we sat still for another 2minutes unable to speak or move. We ran to my mothers room and told her and that was about it. My old best friend isnt my fiend anymore. He did some stuff with my sister and that drove me away and last I saw him he was really really into drugs. I dont kno where or how he is now.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

It was flying at a low altitude and it passed right above me, overhead. The object was traveling south and it was descending at a very slow speed.  It appeared to be under intelligent control, it was not free falling or flying erratically.It lasted about a minute and then it faded out to black in the nightime sky and completely disappeared, almost like it had become cloaked by turning invisible. The object had no visible flashing lights,it was only bright red in color.  There was no sound whatsoever.  The sky was mostly cloudy and it had just rained about 40 minutes prior to the sighting.

Nothing unusual but then I noticed one was moving in unusual patterns and was flashing red light.  It would hover without any movement then it would suddenly move in strange directions.  It darted left, then right, then forward, then backward in random patterns.  It even made half circles, full circles, and a figure 8.  I called my family out to see it because I couldn't figure out what it was.  It wasn't a plane because of the patterns and it wasn't a helicopter because it was so far up in the sky.  This went on for about an hour until it faded in the distance.  I called the local police and they said they had no other reports.  I then noticed another one several miles away from the first one which was still visible.  Finally I went out in front of the house and noted a third.  Also while this was occuring, there were continuous flashes of white light which appeared to be closer to the ground.

They appeared at the same height (elevation) after going out and returning several times.  They were behind a tower and bracketed by tree branches.  Gauging their height, they appeared to be 25 to 30 feet off the ground.  They would come back each time in different intensities and colors of red or white.On or about their eighth or ninth return, they were mostly red, not as bright but one red light was ejected upward in an arch to the east.The lights seemed to hover and when bright, it appeared to have a mist around them and connected by a reflective surface.  Two prominent white lights most often appeared brightly when returning and the reflective surface was more enhanced in their glare.I returned this morning at 0700 hrs.  The next morning, I snapped pictures to better to define what was in this area to make up the tower.The lights, each time, would return in a different position and in different colors and numbers.  Sometimes their position was more to the right of the tower and sometimes more to the right, but always the same height.My wife was also present and saw this event I went into the building and came out an hour later and did not notice more lights.I\u2019m still looking for other causes for this.

It seemed to me that the military aircraft were in pursuit or observing the object.This object moved in a manner,with a grace and speed that I have never witnessed.It was quite fascinating.", "Inverted V shaped crafts with orange lights in North Everett, WA.It was approximately 8:15 pm, and I was in my kitchen facing north talking to my sister on the phone.  In my peripheral vision there appeared to be the big dippers and the \"stars\" were unusually bright.  After a few more moments of conversation, I remembered that the big dipper is seen from the east at this time of year and never so low, so bright in the sky and never from the north.I looked out the kitchen window and saw an inverted V shaped formation of bright orange lights. There were three lights on the left side of the formation and two on the right side.  They didn't blink, just a steady light.  I ran outside to investigate and the formation turned from a side v formation to the inverted V.  A bright orange lights moved very fast and secured itself to the right side of the v-formation so now there were three orange lights on both sides. Another inverted V-shaped craft moved in front of the first and they moved in sync very slowly and methodically through the night sky towards the sound.At first glance I thought the orange lights were individual crafts moving in a carefully orchestrated procession through the sky.  After running outside for a better look, I concluded that it was two massive crafts, solid black in color and the inverted V orange lights were part of the crafts.  I was alarmed and scared as this was close, just above the tree line and electrical power lines.  I got the eerie feeling we were being invaded by paratroopers from another country until I saw the crafts.I did some online research and reported this sighting.", "On July 4th Looked like 1 round fireball, but was 3,,  55 PicturesI live in a small town of Fort Calhoun about 860 people (not much light at night) on the top of a hill so the stars are real bright. This is about 8 miles North of Omaha, Nebraska.On the night of the fourth of July, I was standing out at the end of my driveway taking pictures of fireworks with a Canon 40D SLR with a digital image stabilizing lens that is 70-300mm zoom.  (About $3000.00 worth of equipment). I was not using a tripod, but hand held so I could move around to catch the fireworks.The front of my house faces straight West.  The night had a broken cloud base, more open than clouds.  At approximately 9:55 pm I noticed a reddish orange light to the South, South west from where I was standing about 2 to 3 miles away coming from the Bennington Nebraska area.  It was moving very slow to slow to be a plane and heading almost straight North.  It had no blinking lights at all. It was just above the cloud base.  I had my camera set on manual mode and was running the shutter speed between 4 and 8. I took a few pictures of the light and after zooming in on it I could see that it wasn\u2019t one light, but three real close together.  We have had helicopters come by and at about that distance before and we could not hear a thing when normally we could.  After watching it for about 5 minutes, I went back to the house to get my wife and show it to her.  Of course she saw it also.They continued to travel North until they were just South of my location, then took a 90 degree turn to the East for a very short distance (guessing \u00bd to 1 mile) then another 90 degree turn back to the South.  Looking at the night sky it would be like the directions of the eraser end of a new pencil.  After watching them head back South about \u00bd the distance from when I first noticed them.  It was like someone threw a light switch and the lights went out.  Gone.  Way before they would have flown out of sight.About 10 to 15 minutes later I saw them again straight in front of my house, looking West.  They looked to be about 1 to 2 miles out.  There were different times that through the camera I could see that they didn\u2019t stay in a group, but would spread out in a line.  If it was one object I would see a leader and then a trail, with the lens settings I was using,  However you can see the trails, but with three balls in the trail.  A leader, one in the middle and one towards the end.  I took 55 pictures of them in all.  They kept heading in a Northern direction and it looked like they would have gone just North of Blair Nebraska.  Some pictures came out pretty good, some not, due to the speed of the lens or my movement.  The entire time that they were visible was about 20 to 30 minutes.", "Blue Green and multi colored Orb  2 pix 1 filmclipOn 7/6/08 22:30 looking up at the stars I noticed a flashing pulsar then 3 more, I rarely saw four in a straight line east to west, so I decided to set-up my telescope celestron 130 slt with 2X Barlow lens with plossl fully coated 12.5mm and noticed they were or seemed to be rotating and flashing like a siren all type of torques colors blue green as Well as red white.called my wife out to take a look and a few friends were all equally amazed , I took 20 pics and 5 movie clips was there for a good hour and a half and then they all disappeared .I panned the skies for another hour I wanted to explain it before I went to bed couldn't find it. However I noticed a lot of what appeared to be satellites (white dots, star like) zipping across the sky in all directions it seemed every few minutes another one would cross the viewfinder path moved to quickly to see through telescope so I grabbed my binoculars some would disappear or fade out before 15* to horizon other would make it all the way assuming they continued I can only follow to about 5 degrees.Still curious I grabbed my night vision Single Scope made in Russia night Owl optics Give a pretty big view plus 10 x 35 mag. I haven\u2019t found away to take pics through it but will come up with something what I saw was pretty amazing, I aimed into the sky ( above my head) then flipped on infrared within a minute I began seeing moving white dots (all stars look like white dots through the night vision some lager then others, lots of them) I was telling myself this must be normal a lot of debris up there.

It was somewhere around 10:30 am.  The sky was clear blue, not a cloud in sight.  The \"ufos\" were directly above the interstate northbound lanes.  When I first noticed them they were spread out evening to form an arch shape.  When I saw them in this formation they looked to be an oblong shape and either metallic/reflective.  They then quickly transitioned into a different formation... more of a comet tail, but now they looked more triangular.  Then then moved to a random pattern and sort of individual disappeared but before they disappeared it almost looked like they were flashing lights except it seemed to be more of a reflective light (like a mirror in the sun)... all within a second or two.  Then I looked over towards the south bound lanes of the interstate and they appeared in the random formation past that side of the highway and then disappeared again.  They literally disappeared in one spot and reappeared in another.At first when I saw the oblong shapes I thought it might have been wings from a small plane but then when they changed shaped and moved at such rapids speeds I threw that theory out the window. From what I could tell it couldn't have been planes at the speed the had to have traveled to get from point a to point b.  I for sure counted 6 \"ufos\" but feel like there might have been a 7th one visible at one point, but I'm unsure.Later that evening I tried googling UFOs sightings in Texas and nothing came up.  I have continued to randomly search the internet to see if someone else might have reported something but it still looks as if I'm the only one.", "Large saucer shaped spacecraft sighted 9-12-08 around 8 P. M. in North Las Vegas, NV.On 9-12-08 at around 8 P.M. I was returning home from work and dinner. I was alone and had entered my complex when I saw a large saucer shaped spacecraft. My first thought was that what I was seeing could not be for real. It was so big and unmistakably an alien craft, or a projection of one, that I could not believe what I was seeing. It appeared to be spinning and changed colors. The only colors I remember vividly were pink and green. Because of the size of the craft, I started to get nervous thinking that this could be an invasion. Instead of stopping I slowly turned down my street and eventually lost sight of the craft. I pulled into the driveway and went into the house for my binoculars. I was not able to find it again. When I returned to my house I put on the Sunday night Football game to get the score and I had some old fashioned radio like static for a couple of minutes.I can not believe no one else saw this.", "Two oval shaped UFOs in Bardstown KYI witnessed, what I believe to be two unidentified objects in the sky about 4:15 p.m. on Sunday, June 22nd.  I was heading east from Bardstown going to I-65.  I noticed to the south of me two object which appeared to be white (or silver reflection).  They stayed stationary and were about 100 yards from each other, maybe a couple of thousand feet off the ground (above the tree line).  I even rolled down the window hoping I would hear something, but to no avail I did not hear anything.  Then I thought they were advertising balloons, but I could not convince myself they were balloons.  This is my very first experience witnessing such aircraft(s). I was wondering if there is anyway you can confirm if there were other reports like this one.  I do not know anyone in Bardstown other than the friends house I was leaving.", "Bright blue orb in TorontoI was walking my dog around the neighbourhood and talking on my phone to a friend.  I saw a bright blue \"orb\" that was much larger than a plane.   It was as bright, or brighter, than a star/planet, but the only way to describe the colour would be \"LED blue.\"  It also appeared to have this \"spot\" on it that was pink or red, but i wouldnt call it a \"light\" (like the lights on planes) it just appeared to be part of the colour...it didn't blink. It caught my attention and I stopped and looked at it, while telling the person on the phone all about it. I'm not someone who is &quot;into&quot; UFO stuff.  I'm describing everything I'm seeing to him and he says take a video, I try to but you cant take a video and talk at the same time (iphone.)  I thought it would go away or that maybe it was a star or planet, but when it started bobbing I had to hang up on the friend to shoot the video.  2 people behind me were walking on the sidewalk ! and also looked up at it.  They kept looking up at it as they walked away, but they didnt speak to me and just kept walking and looking back at it.  I cant estimate the distance because I am really bad with that, but you can tell by the size and distance of the plane that passes by on the video that it is very high up and much larger than the plane. When i started taking the video it appeared stationary.  Although it was bright blue to my eye it showed up bright white on the camera, although some shots when it moves show it blue.  Anyway, it was just hovering very high in the air.  I can't say it was \"in any directio.\"   but I was facing south.  Then a plane travelled across the sky (from west to east) and below it (I couldn't see the plane's entire path because a house blocked the view at that point).  But, it started to move subtly when the plane went under.  Then it bobbed a bit and dropped and then quickly \"zoomed\" off in a westerly direction.  The same speed as watching a satellite against stars.  I ran around the corner! to the street behind the house to try and see it, facing west.  There were so many trees but this time it showed up blue on the video too.  It appeared to sort of bob or \"float down,\" faster than before and then drop out of view.  I ran around to the park to see if i could find it again, but it was gone or my view was blocked by all the houses and trees. Never saw anything after that.  When i went home and watched the videos I noticed that when I thought it was stationary it was actually slowly moving at times.  Moving and stopping.  Fast and slow at the same time if that makes sense.Here is a link to my videos: 1) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8OFCaNNvG0 2) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6mSGP0H6eg", "At approximately 17:57 my girlfriend and I witnessed an unidentified craft emitting a large amount of light while leaving a teal light trail in it's wake at an altitude of a commercial airliner.((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.

From where I stood (at 19th and Spring Garden Sts.) it appeared to be moving from north to south. I noticed that there was absolutely no sound coming from it.

Planes crossing the Atlantic, arriving at Lisbon's International Airport usually do their approach exactly over the area where I live so I'm very used to watching them and I recognize their navigation lights.I can say for certain that it wasn't a (conventional) plane because the light was completely different, it was much lower than a plane, and it crossed the sky alot quicker than a plane, as it completely disappeared from my sight in about 1-2 minutes.At the time of the sighting there wes a civilian plane on the sky, so besides the obvious differences I also had real time comparison with an actual plane.I called the Portuguese Air Force 30 minutes after the sighting and told them what I had seen, and they were very helpful and asked me the (I assume) usual questions: estimated altitude of the object, duration of the sighting, etc. and told me they would get back to me.They did, 10 minutes after that, and the person told me he had contacted civilian and military airtraffic controllers and they didn't saw anything on radar.I'm sorry I didn't took any pictures or recorded the sighting, but even if I had a camera with me, I don't think I would have anyway, since it didn't even crossed my mind long after the sighting was done.

The lights were blue, purple, green and red.  It also looked like there was something very very black. Like a black hole or portal.  There was at one point a green portal and in that area the sky became distorted as if sucking in whatever was in that area.  There were also purple portals and blue portals.

More than 10 just zooming across the sky.At one point I was staring at one specific cloud where a portal had opened up. There was a black object that was incredibly huge.  It had a shape of a statue. Like the Statue of Liberty with spikes and very tall.  It looked like that but at the same time seemed to be morphing into something else.  Then the cloud covered it and I saw the portal get smaller and smaller. A lot of these objects were cloaked.There is a lot more to this and the weeks following it had a lot of the same events mostly consisting of the cloaked disk shaped with the clouds.These clouds had lights in them and didn't look like normal clouds.  They would change shapes quickly and looked like they were writing out something in the sky in a strange way. It also had weird figures and faces.  Like if they were trying to get me to understand something.  At that point I panicked and went inside. I know this sounds unbelievable but it is true.  If I recall anymore I will report back.  I would also like to add that on the weeks following this there were a lot of airplanes or helicopters in the sky as if they were searching for something.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I couldn't help but notice viewing this same object to the south as it was getting closer and seemed to be travelling approximately in the same direction as I.It looked at first like a horizontal line of lights; as a large well lit jumbo jet; I said to myself, \"gee,  wouldn't it be great if that were a UFO\". As I continued on the Cross County Parkway west, I could see it was gaining on me, and our path's were intersecting.When decending down the hill to where the Cross County joins the Saw Mill Parkway, I was startled as I looked up to see, getting closer and closer from my car window, an object about 1000 feet up that was a flat, black rectangle with six groups of lights configured  in a triangular pattern.The six groups of multi-colored lights were symmetrically placed in rows that were evenly spaced along this football field sized rectanglar object. 2 groups in the front, 2 in the middle, and 2 in the rear; spread out and disernable as groups. Each group of lights was of a slightly different tint or color, mostly whiteish with some being pinkish or reddish.It was generally an overcast night with some low level visibility which explains why I could have seen it so far away at first. I distinctly remember that it was also a moonless night.The large rectangular shape was clearly defined against the muddy low cloud cover as illuminated by the omnipresent static greenish-pink urban glow.This thing was not a group of planes or a blimp. It was a solid rectanular platform, and I descibed it to others as being easily as big as a football field. It also struck me odd that it was completely silent. I estimated that it was travelling at about 60 MPH as I slowed my car to almost a stop  with my head sticking out the window looking up in amazment. There were other cars slowing down and pulling to the shoulder to watch it also.As my route north up the Saw Mill Parkway was heading directly in it's trail, I watched as it travelled northwest diagonally over Yonkers with it's distinct 6 red rear lights stretching it's stern width. I don't think it was moving much faster than a car, as I visually followed it's path over the low land valley of Yonkers over the ridge while towards the Hudson River. This is a very hilly ares with multple views, even the far horizon of the palisades with it's famous FM tower to the west. I quickly manuvered through the back street and up the hill to my destination as I was on my way to my grandparent's  house which sits high on a hill, and commands a great view of the Hudson River, Palisades and the Hudson valley to the north.The six 6 red lights across it's stern were clearly visible for at least 20 minutes as it cruised north up over the Hudson.The next day the local paper had some story about a \"UFO\" or \"Strange Lights\" observed by numerous people. I was confused by the story, because it seemed un-related to me as the people interviewed  described it as being \"greenish in color\".Also, I found it strange that the news story mentioned that the sighting location was over the vicinity of the town of Ardsley; which is further northeast.I've told this story to a lot of people over the years, and I'm telling it to you the same way.  I can remember this incident as vividly as if it had happened yesterday and I swear it to be true.I always assumed that it was some \"U.S. government\" flying platform possibly on it's way the the Air force field at Newburg  N.Y.((NUFORC Note:  Date in October 1987 is approximate.

It was moving straight downwards to earth but didn't really seem to be travelling very much, didn't move much, moved very slowly, despite the chemtrail behind it.

The second seemed like a star but it was too high up to say anything about it and was moving very rappidly also not in a steady motion.The third was astonishing.

We don't have all the answers as facts because we all need to find faith in order ! to get the answers we want or wait untill we die.  That's what makes us God's favorite creation, remember that we are a creation from above.  I searched for many answers during my first experiences and I found many answers with nobody's help.

We were on I-10 eastbound, driving 70-ish, in abnormally non-existent traffic for a Friday night.  When we were a couple of miles past the Davis Hwy interchange, I noticed a light twin airplane passing overhead and to my left (north of highway), going south, low in altitude (200-300 ft) presumably for landing (as we could see landing lights and gear extended). This isn't unusual, the traffic patterns frequently pass over for that particular runway.  But, a bright ring of 10 or more amber lights behind/beside the plane startled me, thinking someone just launched a ring-shaped fireworks display in dangerously close proximity to this landing plane.As the plane continued, apparently ignorant of these lights, the mystery lights seemed to shut off, and disappear rather quickly.  I quickly asked my wife if she had seen these \"fireworks,\" as she was in the front passenger seat of our jeep wrangler.  She said she had not, but as I started to describe the lights (8-12 in number) as we continued down the road, they reappeared, as if they \"turned on\" with a switch, still to my left, above the trees, but at least 1000-2000ft (east) from where I saw it last.  It seemed as though whatever it was, it was moving at least 80+ mph, since it reappeared slightly ahead of us, and we were going E @ 70 mph. My wife saw it this time, and agreed it did look like fireworks (in shape and color), only to watch it disappear seconds later again, instantly. We were now a little confused, knowing it was not a plane, blimp, flares, or a mobile fireworks platform.As we continued east, and are struggling to say anything further, it reappears again, instantly, and it is now apparent that these lights (8-12, unsure of number) must be fixed to a solid object, and are flashing at an interval of a couple seconds on (all of them), and then off simultaneously for a couple seconds. It was apparently tracking to the east-south-east, heading towards the bay and beyond. As the interstate curves to the north approaching Scenic Highway, the object crossed over the lanes, and because of its altitude and direction, my wife thought it would hit the Ramada Inn. It passed over though, still blinking its amber lights rhythmically, and we followed it on the off-ramp to Scenic Hwy. When we got to the traffic light, my wife frantically pleaded that we go south on Scenic and follow it. I just sat and stared as it continued east-southeast over the bay, apparently unable to speak or drive, or follow my wife's instructions. She asked me several more times, and! I instead turned North to go home. I don't know why I didn't follow it, I wished that I had, but something majorly psychological was computing in my brain, and refusing to accept what we knew we just saw. I had never seen a ufo before, but my life has not been the same since.I am glad that my wife saw it as well, otherwise I would think I was crazy. We went home and drew independent pictures, and the only variance was our perspective, while I saw a complete ring, she saw something closer to that of an omega/horse-shoe/open ring. The color was the same in both of our perspectives, somewhere between orange and yellow, amber would be the best word in my opinion. The distance/size was nearly impossible to perceive, it could have been 30 feet above, 300 feet above, or 3000 feet above. The limiting factors were the trees it passed over, the plane it did not collide with, and the high cloud ceiling. In my opinion, it would seem as though it were close to 300 feet in altitude, considering it cleared the trees, and seemed to follow the path of the interstate. If it were at that distance, I would estimate it's size to be 50-100 feet in \"diameter\", but that's only an estimation based on estimated height. The light twin airplane seen at the beginning of the! sighting was estimated nearly 200-300 feet ( could have been even 500 feet ) in altitude, and with my life experience around planes/airports/military air stations, I can safely assume that the wingspan of the plane was 20-30 feet tops. The ring was nearly twice the size of the plane when they were in \"close\" proximity to each other, but I don't have experience around such phenomenon to know what normal is for size or distance.We could not hear a sound, but our Jeep is noisy on the freeway. By comparison, the airplane was audible and sounded like a turboprop (it may have been a reciprocating prop w/ 3-blade engines, however, not really sure at the glance we had in those conditions), and was briefly and typically heard as it passed overhead. We don't know what the environmental conditions for wind were, windows were up and the temperature was unknown as well (A/C was probably on), there were no visible stars or moon, cloud ceiling was high enough not to reflect billboard lights or other urban lighting that is typical in the area. When we rolled to a stop at the offramp traffic light, the road noise diminshed and no sound was perceived as the ring of lights continued east over the bay.I have considered and reconsidered repeatedly what it was or was not, and can only say what it was not based on several key facts. 1) It was not a satellite, I have seen hundreds in my lifetime, none of them were amber, or traveling in coordinated groups/formation. 2) It was not meteor or comet, I have seen hundreds of either in my lifetime, including several meteor showers and eye-visible comets, they do not remain in formation over 3 miles and flash off and on repeatedly. 3) It was not military flares, I have seen those on t.v. and other videos, I am fairly certain they would not be dropped over the interstate or next to civilian aircraft on approach to landing, not to mention the residential areas that surrounded the freeway. There are many bases nearby, both air force and navy, and Eglin's expanse seems like a more logical testing site for such activities as flare drops. 4) I don't believe it was a blimp, the size could match, but the lights (we frequently see the Tostit! o's and Goodyear blimps at night and day flying to KPNS) and speed (over 70 MPH) seem unreasonable. 5) I don't think it was a civilian aircraft due to the other air traffic's close proximity, and there were no typical light patterns (no strobes, nav lights, or anti-collision lights), and I have never seen a disc shaped plane (I think the government mothballed most 50 years ago for various reasons). 6) The only other rational reason is bunk as well, if it was a 'top-secret' military aircraft, I think the above mentioned location (interstate 10, densely residential NE Pensacola, planes landing at the same time) would have blown the cover of a black project. Again, with nearby expanses of unpopulated testing grounds like Eglin AFB and others, I don't see why a secret aircraft would fly directly over I-10 or get dangerously close to other landing airplanes, that is not very inconspicuous, or top secret either. That leaves ball lightning or swamp gas, and I have never heard of s! uch phenomenon appearing as our sighting did. But I am not an ! expert.I grew up in the area, my father was a Navy pilot and flight instructor, and my time in Civil Air Patrol years ago has provided experience around many civilian and military airplanes.  We do not have photos, or video, I think even if we had such equipment at the time, we were too dumbfounded to even use such devices.  I will send in drawings/renderings that have been made since.

There were almost 10 to 15 of them.  There were 3 or 4 of them coming together at a central point at a time, then spreading out in all different directions, and then came back together again to the center.

On the night of the blackout I noticed a strange object hovering over the darkened Manhattan skyline. It appeared to be round and silver colored (very bright). Red lights were revolving around it on what looked like a 'ring'. These revolving red lights were what got my attention. They rotated & flashed on the 'ring' non-stop. The travel path of the red lights convinced me I wasn't seeing a helicopter since they were circling a *round* or *oblong* object. It remained stationary for approx 3-4 hours then disappeared from view around midnight - 1AM. I did not see it 'leave' the sky. I turned my attention from the window and when I looked out again it was gone. The UFO remained over the skyline for approx 3 hours.

I was in training at Fort Gordon (military base) in the 31-R course (Tactical Multi-Channel Transmission Systems Operator Maintainer). We were on a very large open field that we called \"The antenna field\" thats right behind the PX at Fort Gordon, there's also some old barracks that are no longer used (more useless information: These old barracks were used [as the barracks] in the Clint Eastwood movie \"Heart Break Ridge\"). We were learning how to install the 9 meter antenna mast (used with a Radio Access Unit). It requires a minimum of 3 soldiers to install (although I've figured out a way that ONE troop could do it), we had four soldiers and one of our two civilian instructors (GTE employees - working for the GTE Resident School, Now called the General Dynamics Resident School). I was holding the Kevlar anchor cable, getting ready to lock it down - we were almost done making adjustments, when I heard the soldier to my right (Private Shaw) SCREAM at the top of his lungs \"LOOK AT THAT %#*(^%  UFO!!\" (thats exactly what he said). I looked up and saw a HUGE light streaking across the sky at incredible speeds. I dont know what I could compare it to since it was like nothing I've ever seen in my life. The civilian instructor didn't even look up, and he yelled at ME for taking my eyes off the anchor cable! (he yelled \"((name deleted)) pay attention to what your doing!\"). So I looked down just long enough to lock the cable down (less than one second) and when I looked back up it was gone. Several nights later we were putting up a 30 meter mast and not every team would end up working because it took the entire duration of a class to do (and not enough masts for each group) so on this night my team was in a large white tent watching movies (most of which sucked) and eating crappy chinese food. I was bored with the movie so I went outside & looked up (still freaking out because of the previous sighting several days ago). I saw a bright lig! ht in the sky far off in the distance. One would have mistaken it for a star if not familiar with the constelations (which I am). It was sitting inside of Orion - I knew it didn't belong there (there's only supposed to be SEVEN stars in the Orion constelation). It didn't move for about 5 hours - even as the stars moved away from it through out the night (I kept going back out & kept track of it) it stayed in the same spot - it's position in relation to the constelations continued to change as the stars moved through the sky. I only stared at it for about 15 minutes each time (how long can you stare at ANYTHING before you get bored?). Towards the end of the night I went back outside & noticed that the light was no longer there - but there were about 6 Black Hawk helicopters flying all the way AROUND the spot where it was. They were NOT passing THROUGH the area where the light was! (even though it was no longer there) But going ALL THE WAY AROUND that area!

They were very far apart spread across the entire sky but exhibited the same behavior, they would drift back and forth and each stayed in the same vicinity of the sky.

Sometimes they would grow dimmer and brighter, and sometimes they would move quickly and other times stop moving completely.

I expected the meteor to disintigrate, as most do after they fall to the earth, but as it approached zenith, the object began to have a  glowing white trail after it, so I assumed it was a fighter jet, but the object made no sound like a jet and made no jet trail. A little past zenith, in the eastern part of the sky the object began to slow down and without any indication, the object split into four separate parts, a bright, large portion that continued on the original path of northwest to southeast, and three smaller pieces that went northeast, northwest and southeast. The smaller pieces from the object were just like the original, except they were smaller and they were yellow instead of gold. Almost immediately after ejecting the ! three smaller objects, the large one vanished, then the other three objects vanished a half second later. The object, which became three seperate, but similar objects was visible in the sky for about a minute, and after it was over I finished drinking my coke and went inside my home.

Circled our house a few times and did a 180.It was around 9:30 EST, when me and my mother were driving home from a religious meeting.  Coming down our road we noticed a light in the air that strangely was not moving. Pulling into our drive, we stopped and observed it directly hovering over our neighbors house (which conveniently was a farm house).  Observing it, we quickly came to the conclusion that it was not an airplane.A sudden gasp was heard from our Jeep as the three hovering lights turned into a large white ball of light, like a spotlight, blinding us.  This ended in a matter of seconds. Immediately we called the farmer, but he wasn't able to see it.  We saw it clear as day, it was like nothing we had seen before.Even pulling into our wooded driveway, it was bright enough that we could still see it.  We sat talking to the farmer for around 5 minutes watching the craft go in a back and forth pattern with sharp turns over his house.  Here it starting moving closer to us.We pulled the rest of the way up our driveway, and the garage was having trouble opening (most likely a coincidence, it does it sometimes) so we sat and watched it longer.  At this point it was dangerously close to our house.From this point on and when we got inside, you could see a triangle of different color lights (white, red, green, blue) that changed colors, similarly to an airplane it seemed at first, but this was not functioning at all like an airplane.  Then the whole craft turned red. My father here pointed out that he could hear it, and it sounded like an airplane, until the sound abruptly stopped.  Before it was moving very slowly, but now it was moving quicker and making very sharp terms.Finally, it moved out of our sight, slowly again.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  The only explanation is brand new military craft or alien ship. Coincidentally, I was talking about UFOs to my father a few nights prior, which was strange.

There is a bypass just before Ballater which lets you miss going all the way through the village. At about 7.15pm, 400 yards or so from the bypass turn off, both Peter and I looked up to our left and saw an object in the sky. It was triangular, looked to be grey in colour and its predominant feature was that it had 3 large blue lights at each point (but not on the very tips). These lights were not flickering or flashing and did not appear to emit any beams as such. It also looked as if there were white/grey laser beams coming out from the opposite side of the object (to the blue lights) however, it may have been the 'top' of the object lit up by more lights. The object looked to be about the size of a house. I have been calling it an object but it definately was some kind of aircraft as it was hovering maybe 200 yards above the trees to the side of the road. I could hear what seemed to be a helicopter, however, if the helicopter had been overhead, it would have been much noisier and what I heard was a muted rotor sound. There was no sign of any other aircraft such as a helicopter nearby. When I heard this noise I assumed that it must be a helicopter because of the relative proximity that this craft would have been to Balmoral Castle (7 miles approx). I believe that the airspace around the castle is restricted and that it is monitored so if there are any unauthorised aircraft in or nearby this area, the airforce scramble jets etc to investigate. There were no jets which I found strange but perhaps it was outside the restriction zone.

My next-door neighbor was on Facebook on his phone when he saw a posting from another neighbor, XXXX, down the street about the unidentified lights in the sky. So XXX, my next-door neighbor, went outside to look at what XXXX was writing about.  Dan got very excited and called me and my husband outside, to see the lights.  They appeared in the north sky in an equilateral triangle formation, with one light at the apex of the triangle and two at the bottom.  The lights were orange in color and looked rather like flames or that they were shimmering.  All three lights hovered in the triangular pattern for a few minutes, and then it appeared that the two lights at the bottom of the triangle were growing dimmer until they finally disappeared. I ran into the house and got a pair of binoculars, through which I viewed the remaining light. It was still a bit blurry for me, so I! gave the binoculars to my husband. He said the remaining light appeared to be an array of parallel lights numbering 4 on each side, with a white light on the top and bottom of the array, in the middle of the parallel. The remaining light began to move slowly west in the sky for several minutes until it too, disappeared.

This was witnessed by multiple observers.1)  A very bright white light flashed on the south horizon and proceeded to the north horizon, flashing irregularly, but frequent enough to track its trajectory easily.  It traveled faster than anyone present had ever previously observed.  The flashes were one to two seconds in duration.  It appeared to be in the upper atmosphere, substantially higher than the many aircraft nearly constantly present.  We also saw plenty of satellites, which moved at a fraction of the object.  I estimate it traveled from horizon to horizon in less than 15 seconds.2)  Approximately 20 minutes later the light reappeared, but this time it was directly in the center of our field of view, around 35-40 degrees above the horizon.  It flashed with the same frequency, but remained near motionless in the sky.  I believe it did move, but so little some of us felt it was completely motionless.  It remained in position for approximately 5 minutes, and then stopped flashing. When it was not lit, the sky appeared empty at its location.I am an Air Force vet, trained weather observer, and this event was unique in my experience.  This was no meteor, of which we saw many.None of us had an explanation for what we saw beyond the possibility that we witnessed secret technologies of our military (our location was approximately 120 miles from the Groom Lake, NV area), or a UFO of extraterrestrial origin.  This was pure speculation, and the entire incident remains a puzzling mystery.I do note that this sounds very similar to the descriptions of others on this site.", "Large cigar shaped hovering craft with flashing lights.I have always wanted to report this but never knew who to tell unti last night. I think something very interesting about my encounter is that it happened again in 1989. The first encounter happened when I was 8 years old with my friend ((name deleted)) also 8. We were camping out in his front yard. He and his family lived out in the country. We were about to go to sleep in his Pop up trailer and all of a sudden there was a very deep thrust noise and the trailer began to vibrate. We ran outside to see what was happening and looked up and saw a very large cigar shaped object hovering above us. Lights underneath the craft of different colors seemed to flash from left to right one after the other across the bottom of the craft. We ran inside to get binoculars and accidentally wake up his father who than came out with us. We were outside again within seconds and the craft was gone. We did think we could barely see it hovering on the horizon for some time but it was too far away to see anything. Chad and I were avid model airplane builders and were very familiar with military aircraft. We knew what we saw was not a blimp because there was no way it could have hovered over us and then been miles off the horizon within seconds. My second encounter happened in 1989. Also in Midland, at my child hood home. At approximately 2am again I had pulled into my driveway after leaving my girlfriends home. I decided to listen to a song before I went inside. As I was sitting in my car my car began to vibrate and I heard a very low base noise. Suprised, I made sure my woofers were turned off in my car and turned down my stereo. I noticed lights reflecting off my sisters car and immediately looked around for other cars and there were none in sight. Then I noticed the lights were reflecting off the top of her car. I got out, looked up and saw once again a large cigar shaped object with lights flashing left to right across the bottom of the craft. Both times it seemed to to be about 100 yards long and about 100 ft. in the air. Once again I ran inside to get binoculars and ran back outside (waking my mother accidentally). once again it was gone. As I scanned the horizon I could see it. This time I was 19 and had a car so I got into my car to chase it. I never could get any closer to it. It seemed to just stay out of my visual reference, no matter how far I drove. So I turned around and went home. Thank you for your time, please call with any questions or collaborating evidence.

I can\u2019t stop wondering what it was that I and my 26 year old and 18 year old sons and 4 other people witnessed in Anderson, CA,. on New Year\u2019s Eve 2011 at about midnight.Here\u2019s what I do know, that none of us were drunk, other people in Anderson witnessed it too, they made no sound, there were no other aircraft in the vicinity, we all saw at least 8 of them fly together in the same direction but like they were dancing with each other, or playing \"catch me if you can,\" we saw them move towards us in the southern sky, we then saw them disappear, we then saw 3 of them re-appear in the eastern sky and make a triangle pattern, then 2 of them started to move away from the third, then change from orange to a white ghostly silhouette and suddenly dart away at a faster than humanly possible speed and disappeared in the sky above us.I posted my story on this website a few days after this event and not surprisingly someone else from Anderson, CA, posted their story, too.  We spoke a little online about it, but I never met the other witnesses. I hope to hear from them again someday.  As this becomes a more common experience for people, I hope we keep the curiosity up.  Don\u2019t become complacent, there is something out there.  It\u2019s definitely not Chinese lanterns.  It could be a light trick or something to do with laser points of light.  It could very well be intelligent beings other than humans.  It did kind of creep us out and we did have thoughts about what if it\u2019s something scary and unknown.I\u2019ve seen video and testimony from witnesses who have seen the same thing and had similar reactions to it from as far back as the 1990\u2019s. It\u2019s just more common to hear of it lately it seems.  It reminds me of what early man must have thought about weird things in the night sky.  They must of thought the Gods were angry or the world was going to end.  I\u2019m not a religious man and I believe that when the world ends for man, it will likely be from our own doings and the world will go on without us just fine.

The path is directly overhead and quite low. Looking up I saw something that is very hard to explain. It started out drifting from the same direction that planes normally fly to land. They were higher than normal planes and it was too high to land and it did not look like that was the purpose.There were 5 round metallic looking structures all drifting together. They changed shape and direction but kept going on the same straight upward path over the airport. The 5 silent objects circled each other and did weird crazy 8 like movements all while changing shape and color.I looked away and looked back 3 times and wiped my eyes trying to figure out what I was looking at.I finally lost sight of it when I could no longer look into the sun. It seemed to fly into the Sun or at least in that direction so it could not be visible. They were floating in the same straight path the whole time.They were not balloons and it was not planes flying in formation.

We were first contacted Saturday night, January 7, 1995, by an Operations Officer in TEMA, who reported to us that the event had occurred, and that their offices had been activated, as a result of the strange event, and subsequent explosion.  The latter was so dramatic that a member of the local aviation community, who had witnessed the event, immediately following the explosion, drove to the airport and took off in an aircraft to search for what he was certain had been an airliner that had exploded in midair.  TEMA contacted the U. S. Air Force, apparently informing them that a possible UFO event had occurred, and inquiring what TEMA should do.  According to the TEMA official we spoke with, TEMA was informed by the USAF to contact the National UFO Reporting Center.  TEMA did contact our Center by telephone, and faxed to our offices a seven-page document, written by a Warren County Deputy Sheriff, in which that officer describeded the explosion, according to eyewitnesses.

It had 2 or 3 separate yet distinct \"V\" shaped pieces to it or to possibly 3 individual crafts.  Each \"V\" panel had roughly 8 white constant (no blinking or flashing) that made up the V shape itself.  While flying directly overhead at a constant speed and course, the 3 V panels where shifting left, right, forward, backwards, even rolling and each was doing a different pattern from the others all while they kept formation and each shifted directions in sequence..... Hard to explain, to give you an example, imagine the constellation of the little dipper (distinctly grouped stars making a pattern that resembles a simlple looking cooking pot---almost symmetrical square and a straight line, yet these triangles were symmetrical). Now picture looking up at the sky and seeing 3 identical yet seperate little dipper constellations that seem to be caugt on each other just floating through space, tumbling....

I happened to notice an object in the sky, off to the east, which I realized was not moving. After several minutes of glancing back and forth at this object, I went to get my binoculars. The object was standing practically still and it was a black tiangular shape. When I peered at it through the binoculars, I saw what I recall as orange lights along the bottom side of the craft.

They refered me elsewhere and before it was over, I'd phoned the LAPD, Beverly Hills Police, and a military base, recomended to me by whomever I spoke to at the police station.

I had no film in the camera...which I cursed myself for...so all I could do was watch. The amazing thing was that I seemed to be the only one to see it. I remember asking some one from the police department to 'just go outside and look!' and they acted as if I were nuts. Towards the end of the experience, I saw a laser type beam come from the craft down... and because I had been in this apartment during the Northridge Earthquake, and saw the power plant expolode and all the lights flash on and off, I felt as if the beam was going down to where the power plant was.

Saw it very clearly.  It seemed to be close, about 1/8 mile up in the sky.  Appeared at first to be floating.  And, was moving slowly, horizontally, instead of up and at an angle the way planes do.

Just as we were entering Ventura, I looked up in a kind of north westerly direction and saw a long white rectangular object heading slowly east.  I thought that it might have been an airplane but the length and width of it were not consistent with either a jet or a small winged plane.  That's why I kept watching it. As it was moving east, it kind of dipped on the right side and disappeared. I looked all over the sky where it had been but could not find it.  I tried to rationalize that it might have gone in to some haze along the ocean, but as we continued north, there was some haze but not enough to cover the size of the object.

It was about 6:30 in the morning, and we had just taken off.  The sky was dark and clear with very few clouds, and it was my second time on an airliner so I was looking out through the window. As we were passing over a town outside of milwaukee, I noticed a large spotlight passing over a few neighborhoods.  The yards and streets that it passed over were brightly illuminated.  You could see the grass in the fields and chimneys on the rooftops and such as they were being lit up as the light was passing, and you could see the outline of the light. I looked to see a helicopter or even a plane generating the light but I could not find one.  I told my grandpa to look over and check it out and he said he didn't know what it was either.  I was tempted to ask a flight attendant but noticed they were pretty busy, so I just let it go. The moon was out and full, but i've never heard of the moon creating such a focused, concentrated light of which I saw. I followed the light up and you could see the light was in a conic, searchlight projection, but nowhere was there anything to be making it.  No tower, plane, or helicopter.  The light seemed to be shining down from about 1-2 hundred feet up.  I followed the light for a good 2-3 minutes and then it dissapeared.  It was sort of making the same path as the plane, except that it had more of a wavy pattern slowly angling away from the plane and it moved very quickly. It came back into sight again shortly after and then it just vanished, like if someone just flipped off the switch.  I don't know if anybody else had seen it, but it was clearly something strange.

At first we thought it had to have flown over the airport but after thinking about it we knew that wasn't likely as there was a plane landing at that time.  The civilian airport is up on a hill which gave me reference height and we believe it flew over towards there and disappeared in front of the hill.  How we don't know.  It had landing lights on it just like the military and civilian planes all do.  No other lights were displayed.  Distance from exit 59 to the last exit is approximately 7 miles.

My dad was working as a Buyer/Purchasing Agent for The Boeing Company supporting NASA on the early Saturn Rocket and Apollo space programs at the Michoud Assembly Facility.Anyway, I remember my dad was reading the newspaper that I believe was the \"New Orleans Times Picayune.\"  Dad told me a newspaper article said that one of the Pegasus Satellites would be visible in the sky that evening.  This was incredible, because I was so fascinated with all that was going on with the US Space Program and had many Vernher Von Braun and astronomy books.  I was so excited about the news of this Pegasus Satellite that would be visible in the evening sky, that I ran over to my neighbor buddy's house to tell him about this news.  We were so excited about this, that we were out early in my back yard looking up in the dark clear sky before this satellite was to appear overhead.While we were waiting to get a glimpse of the Pegasus Satellite, all of a sudden two circular illuminated objects flew slowly directly over our heads.  The best description that I have, is they were flying in a staggered formation and looked like two circular illuminated objects, illuminated just on their outer perimeters, and there was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  Their distance or altitude to be between 300 and 500 feet.  The direction of flight was from right to left as we were looking directly to the backyard.  We were so astonished that we ran in the house to tell my dad, he laughed about it, although my mom went outside to look and the objects were now gone.   This experience that I had as a young boy has bothered me for years, because of time gone by can cause uncertainty in believing, and as I have always wondered if any other residents of Metairie or Kenner had made any recorded reports of UFOs.   I figured because of the \"New Orleans Times Picayune\" newspaper article that many residents had to be out looking in those evening skies, someone may have seen these objects too.I do not know which Pegasus satellite we were looking to see at the time, as there were actually three that were launched to study micrometeoroid densities for the early Apollo Space program.

It is a dark, dead, straight stretch of road. More than fifty miles ahead, we could see an active city of flashing white glow.  As we neared the city of lights hovering over the left side, my wife pulled off the road and she said,  \u201cLook at this!\u201d I saw a spectacle of the brightest white flashing light ever experienced.  The object was hovering approximately 40 yards away and 50 feet above the ground.  It was so bright in the night sky that I could not make out the shape of the object, or objects.  It was hovering, but not completely stationary, as it slowly wavered 10 degrees down it\u2019s path.  There was no sound.  I peered into the luminescence as I looked up to this swiveling white light at the top sending beams high into the dark sky.  Below, there was a row of blue lights possibly stretching 30 yards across.   I franticly repeated, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d My wife, my eighteen-year-old daughter and ten-year-old grandson were speechless as we, all, looked on in awe.  This experience lasted a mere minute before I resolved quickly, \u201cI\u2019m gonna grab my camera\u201d, reaching in the back window for my camcorder.  Suddenly, as I said this, the lights/object strobe-shifted miles down the road.  The movement was unworldly as there was no humanly audible sound nor any notice of motion to reach it\u2019s distance.  I, still, thought to capture the distant lights to record \u2018something\u2018 of the phenomena.  Again, suddenly, as if there was connection of my intentions, the object shifted considerable distance down the road to be a mere glow.  Within two seconds, the object was here and then had nearly disappeared.  I felt cheated.  My wife began turning the car around until our daughter cried out with all her fear and common sense, \u201cNo, don\u2019t turn around!  Do not turn around!  Do not go after that thing!\u201d  I had never seen my daughter so scaredLooking through the rear window of the car, perplexed with the sudden distant remaining glow, I considered our fortune to live through this experience.  I was, almost hypnotically, mesmerized sensing a lapse of known reality by the object\u2019s peculiar rapid movement.  Now, I question previous understanding.", "Multiple groups of bright orange fireball like lights flying slowly in formation Orlando area.While taking my trash out to the curb, I noticed 3 large, bright orange lights flying lowly in what seemed to be a formation coming from the south.  They were travelling rather slowly and did not have any other flashing lights like you would normally see from an airplane so it struck me as odd.  They made no sound and moved very slowly.  I then noticed 4 more of the same lights coming behind them from the same direction.  I quickly ran in to the house to grab my two kids so they could see them too.  When we got back outside there was another group of 3 coming up from behind the second group.My view in that direction is partially blocked by some tall pine trees so I was only able to see the lights through the breaks in the trees as they moved toward us.  I moved my position to get a different angle so I could see them better after they passed the trees, but they never appeared on the other side.  I then went back to my original spot where I could then see another small group approaching but the first few groups were nowhere to be found.  I followed the lead light in that group to try and see where they were going and it basically seemed like it made a slow hard left turn, travelling away from my vantage point, until it faded from view and the others followed.In total I saw 5 or more groups totaling approximately 16 or more lights.  All were in groups of 2 to 4 and traveled in a similar path in what looked like a loose formation of sorts.  I have never seen anything like this before and in hindsight I wish I had thought to count exactly how many I saw.  I was so surprised at what I was seeing that it never crossed my mind to count how many lights or groups I was seeing.  Each of the lights looked very similar to what an ignited flare looks like, just more orange in color than the vibrant red of a road flare.  I spend lots of time outdoors and love looking at the stars in the night sky. This is the first time I have ever seen anything that I could not identify.", "bright white light flying low and fast heading eastMe and my brother were barbequing outside when I seen a bright light heading east there were planes flying around also and u can see it was not a plane it was moving a lot faster and flying lower than the planes yet made no noise whatsoever it flew right over us and continued heading east we kept our eye on it until we couldn't see it anymore.", "Interesting moon view with telescope, unknown objects.On Oct 23rd, 2004 I purchased a telescope from Wal Mart a 5 inch Meade with a lot of buttons on it. I spent a couple of days trying to learn to use it and took it out the following night. I didn't really know where to start or what to look at so I just decided to check out the surface of the moon. It was really amazing to see all the surface features, craters etc. About an hour had went by of gazing and trying the different powered lenses. I zoomed in on the moon using 25mm eyepiece which will focus on a 3-400 sq. mile area of the moon. I started noticing that about every minute and a half or so, sometimes one but mostly in pairs little black dots would go by as if it were some type of plane orbiting the moon (the moon was full). At first I thought that it was satellites that circle the earth passing in front of the moon, but then I realized that this would have to be something orbiting the moon itself due to the multiple times that these objects traveled the exact same path. The next night I decided to look at the moon again oddly enough I saw the same black dots mostly in pairs and slightly staggered but sometimes only one. I watched this for about 30 minutes, probably 12-13 times. These were very clear black dots and any satellite between here and the moon would not be this clear and so small. So I wrote some emails to astronomers and asked, thinking it would be something easily explainable. The response I got back stated that anything orbiting the moon would be too small to be seen in a telescope and also they knew of nothing currently orbiting the moon. I've looked at the moon a dozen or so times since and have not seen anything.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

They began to shoot through the woods, flicker, change colors but the light always stayed projecting towards us.  The light intensity was unlike anything I know of, many other small blue and red lights were scattered across the mountain as well.  We watched it shift from one set of peaks to another at an unbelievable rate.  As we looked in the sky above we noticed another bright light and it began to shift in zig zags and circles hovering around the night sky, as we looked around we could see a ring of these blue lights that all were moving in the same behavior unlike any of the other stars, or shooting stars in the sky.

It was a pretty clear night with wispy clouds and fairly dark since the moon hadn\u2019t begun to rise.  There were a lot of stars, so we were just chatting and enjoying the view.  Around 21:15, I saw a dark disk-shaped object fly north about 80 degrees from where we were sitting.  I shouted, \u201cLook at that, look at that!\u201d to my spouse, which he immediately did, and witnessed the same thing.  There were no lights, but you could see the shape of it as it passed, causing a bow wave as it passed through some wispy clouds.  I noticed a shadow on it that was in the shape of a \u201cL\u201d.

He banged on the window from outside (I was in the living room)to get me to come look. I got outside and he told me to come quick and was having me look in the sky for a light he saw. It was gone. I thought he was funny and I laughed it off. I \"yea'd\"  him and went back inside.He came in a few minutes after, telling me he was sure it was not an airplane and going on and on about the glowing ball in the sky.

A few minutes after, he banged frantically on the window again, for which we (myself and my 7 year old) both went out the front door to see this thing my husband was talking about.I am not sure what I saw. It was a ball, flying across the sky, unlike anything I have seen before.  It was red-ish, orange-ish-yellow-ish (hard to explain... kind of like a ball of fire. It was not falling from the sky. It was flying.  I would have thought that it were a plane or helicopter with some red lighting or something... but there was no sound whatsoever.  That was something my husband kept saying.... what the hell is that... and listen.... there isn't a sound.  It was not windy or raining... it was dark, but not black out (we had street lights and so on).  I wouldn't not have believed it if I hadn't seen it.  I would have thought it was a completely explainable aircraft, had I not seen it myself.My husband was glad I saw the second one, because I apparently looked at him as though he were a little off or something.I am THE LAST person who you would think you would hear this from.  But I know what I saw was not something usual. If I found out there were some special thing going on at the nearby airport (PEASE, which is a tiny airport, not used for commercial flights), I might have dismissed it.  We have had air shows there before.  But there is nothing going on there that I can find.   And no reports on meteors or any other odd things in our area.  Someone else HAD to have seen it.

I was maybe 15 at the time, living with my parents. I was sleeping, in my own room at the rear of the house, when I was awakened by a noise.

This UFO was the stereotypical UFO for the time and I am not sure that I could even describe it accurately now.  This craft hoovered maybe 15 seconds in this spot ( which seemed like 15 minutes ) and then it departed in a vertical direction until it was pretty high, before moving horizontally.  The next thing that happened was pretty cool.  It was a clear night with a lot of stars visible and I was watching this craft depart out of frozen, excited, curiosity.  It was traveling horizontally when it came to a spot in the sky that was pure black, no stars, and darker in! color than the night sky, as it got to this spot it turned into it an vanished instantly.I was disappointed that it was gone because I wanted to continue to watch and follow this craft, but I was excited because I felt I knew a little something that others didn\u2019t, and that was an explanation of how they are able to travel such great distances.

I have seen and videotaped everything from A-10's to F-14 and F-16 aircraft, as well as Stealth aircraft at near and far range. With the cloud cover, the noise should have been obvious as the sound would have been reflected by the clouds. There was no perceivble sound. Both points of light disappeared into a cloud bank and we saw nothing more after that.  I immediately started running through things in my head to make sure I had time and distance and direction. My girlfriend was freaked out that I was so freaked by the situation.  I also have experience in visually tracking satellites and other space based objects, and nothing I have experience with could explain what I saw. As mentioned, the two objects converged on each other and diverged at a fairly high rate of speed, and remained consistently lit. I have never seen conventional aircraft perform in the manner of these unidentified objects. We went out again tonight, and were able to easily identify any aircraft in the air, including a helicopter returning to Ft Lewis.  Nothing looked or behaved like the objects seen the night before.", "2 lights beneath Saturn move quickly and disappearI was standing on my deck in my backyard, looking up at Saturn through my telescope.  I looked up to the left of Saturn, and was observing the nebula in the constellation Orion.  I turned my head back towards Saturn, and right underneath the planet (without the aid of a telescope), I saw 2 hazy lights appear, move a couple inches underneath Saturn, leave a trail of light, and disappear.  The lights were directly beside each other, and they looked like car headlights.  They were surrounded by a white-ish haze.  The lights moved faster then any airplane, and disappeared very quickly.  I kept staring at the spot where the lights had disappeared to see if there was a trace of anything, but there was nothing there.", "pulsing blue light with irratic movementI saw an indigo blue light that was pulsing.

They were so unlike anything he had ever seen, he was certain they were UFOs.  The sincerity with which he described the experience greatly impressed my mother and me.

Here's the problem the object never moved or a least seem to stay in the same place for a least 45 mins.  When I first saw the object it seem to have a solid white light to it.  As the time pass by the color seem to change to an orange red, but still keeping it's intensity.  I would have to say it was 20 to 25 feet above my visual horizon, but keep in mind the light was some distance away from me.

It was extremely bright and was swiftly moving through the sky north east toward south east.The object made no noise as it continue its path.  It looked as if it was a star but imagine it 1/6th of a full moon, the moon was full so I was able to compare it to the moon.  No other visible lights came from this orb, it was like bright almost ice blue, more white than blue but bright and it just disappeared as it traveled.

I only know that in the fifty years I have lived, I have never seen anything like this since.I lived in a suburb of Dayton, Ohio, in town called Oakwood.   I believe it was the fall of 1967 when I had this encounter, which would put me at about 8 years old.  This phenomenon occurred in the middle of the night after having returned to my bed from the bathroom.After laying back down I noticed a bright, round, moonlike object about a mile to the west and coming closer.  I was so unsure of what I was witnessing that I went to the window to get a better look.  I watched for a couple of minutes as this bright object came closer.  It was now several stories above the tree tops above our neighbor\u2019s backyard. It had no sound and no discernable outline, but only the color of light.  It was round, about 30 feet across, and moving rather slowly.  I had to move to the other window that faced north to our backyard.   I thought about calling out to my mother, but thought that by the time she awoke and got to me, the object would be gone.  Just then the light went out.  It didn\u2019t shoot away or disappear, it just went out.   It wasn\u2019t replaced by a black outline against the sky.  I looked for several more minutes waiting to see if it would light up again or see some outline moving against the sky.  Nothing.I wasn\u2019t scared, just a bit confused, so went back to bed and fell asleep.The next morning, before going to school, I sat at breakfast and told my mother what I saw.   She didn\u2019t have much comment over the subject, so I didn\u2019t push the topic.That day in school we had show and tell.  I remember sitting in a circle to the left of our teacher.   As we went around the circle, I wondered if I should tell about my night.  I did.  To my surprise the teacher didn\u2019t think I was making up stories.  Instead, she said on her way to work she heard on the radio that there had been reports by others who had seen this strange object.I will always wonder what it was, who it was, where it came from or where it went.  I have never seen anything like it to explain away what it was.I have recalled this account so that it might conjure up a memory for someone else that may have seen this around the same time and in the same area.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The orange bursts seem to have come from one of the white dots of light.  On two occasions one light (on the right) of a triangle left its position and passed between the other two and then returned to its original position.

I was taking my dog out before I turned in for the night. I live approximately six miles from town so it is quite dark at night. I sat down on my porch waiting for my dog, the porch is orientated to the due West. My eye caught something moving and at first assumed it was an airplane or helicopter. It was not moving 'right' for a plane and then thought it must be a helicopter at a high hover. It was slowing drifting and then changed color. It was then that I was curious, it was not a plane, why then would it have wing lights that are different colored? I called my for wife to see it and she was not very impressed. It was nothing spectacular. An aircraft was then flying nearly over me at this time and I used it to attempt to judge the distance and altitude of the light. I judged it to be approximately 20 to 25 miles west of me and at 5000 feet above the ground. During the time I observed the light it changed colors several times, at times appearing red, white or blue/white.When it changed colors it blended, it just did not change as if one side was one color and another side was another color. It never moved quickly or any higher or closer. My wife observed it for approximately 5 minutes and then called my Father in law to watch it with me. He watched it with me for another 10 minutes. He said that he observed another two lights to the south that resembled the first. I then called the County Sheriff and asked if they had had any other calls. The Deputy I spoke to then went to the roof and attempted to observe it as well. I know nothing of his observations or lack of. At 0010 hrs the light darkened to a dark red and descended out of site slowly and I did not observe it again.

I have ridden in Pavelows, Pavehawks, Ch-53's, British High Pro Ch-47's, and other conventional types of aircrafts and I have never seen anything like this. I can not explain what I saw.

We were driving home from dinner on Tuesday, September 18, 2012. At approximately 9:00-9:15 p.m. we witnessed an event we have ever seen before.My boyfriend's recollection of the event is a little different than mine. That is why I want to include both of our reports as two different testimonials for the same event.Here is his report: &quot;I am typing this report at 10.30 pm est September 18, 2012.My girlfiend and I were driving home from dinner at about 9:00pm est. We live in Knoxville, TN in an area about 20 miles from McGee-Tyson Airport. We are used to seeing airplanes fly over our neighborhood all the time, and this sighting was absolutely not an airplane. It moved too fast in the sky and in a very strange manner. I am not sure what I witnessed was from another world or something the government may be doing, but it was definately something I have never seen before.It was pitch black outside, and just as we were coming over a steep hill on our way home, I witnessed two distinctively bright lights that appeared to be changing colors from orange- to red- to green. They were very bright, brighter and larger than any other star or plane in the sky.What I witnessed lasted from about 5 to 8 seconds, it was very brief. However, I can say there was no avoiding seeing this because it was obvious something was happening that was not normal.The two lights moved higher in the sky in a coordinated effort, then crossed each other. First making arches in the sky, then creating an &quot;X&quot; path in the sky.The two lights then came together, stopped and held their spots, then took off at opposite directions a speed I have never witnessed.There was also a truck down the road from us that was stopped. We drove towards them, they rolled down their window and told us that they had witnessed the same thing. This was, by far, the strangest thing I have ever seen.The \u201corbs\u201d (as some people have been referring to them) were in the southeastern night sky.&quot; In addition to my boyfriend's report above, I wanted to give my own testimonial for this event: We were coming home from dinner at around 9pm on September 18th. We were coming over a steep hill, and I could see in the sky, much much higher than the tallest trees, two very bright lights. They were circular &quot;orbs&quot;, I guess some people have been calling them. One was red-ish in color and the other was green-ish. They were very bright, much brighter and larger than any star. And they appeared to have a hazy ring around them.What I witnessed only lasted 1 to 2 seconds, but I know that it was not normal. It was not a star, an airplane, or any other &quot;normal&quot; object or light you would expect to see in the night sky.The two lights were moving towards each other, like mirror images. Then they stopped, and separated apart, almost like they were repelled from each other, at a speed I have never witnessed. They moved so fast that you could not keep your eyes on them, then they were simply gone.I did not see the first part where the two lights created arch paths, then &quot;X&quot;ed over each other (as my boyfriend described) because I was looking out the other window, but I did witness the last part of the event, and I can stand with my boyfriend in saying that it was not normal, and something I have never seen before.As soon as this happened, I had a hard time recognizing what happened, I wasn't sure of what I saw, then my boyfriend asked me if I saw it. I immediately knew what he was talking about, and didn't know how to respond. My first response was to call 911 and report it, but we didn't end up doing that.We saw a truck parked down the road of 2 people we have never met. We rolled down our window and they told us they had just witnessed the same event.Basically, I saw one bright red light, or &quot;orb&quot;, and one bright green light. They were large and moved at a speed I have never witnessed before, in the following pattern: First moving towards each other, in a coordinated effort: --&gt;   --&gt;   --&gt;         O    O         &lt;--   &lt;--   &lt;-- When they met, they stopped and held their position, then separated in opposite directions at a speed I have never seen. Exponentially faster than any other airplane: O   &lt;----- &lt;----- &lt;----- &lt;-----       -----&gt; -----&gt; -----&gt; -----&gt;   O Then they were simply gone, nowhere to be seen in the sky. Like I said, what I saw only lasted 1 to 2 seconds, but I do not doubt my boyfriend's testimonial at all. I believe that we saw the same thing, and I believe that he did see the lights first create arch paths in the sky, the &quot;X&quot; over each other.My boyfriend works in sales, and I am a manager at a local company in Knoxville. We make good money. We are not religious, or spiritual, nor are we &quot;UFO hunters&quot;. We have nothing to hide, and we are not looking to be famous. We have never witnessed anything like this before, and we are honest people who just thought that what we saw needed to be reported.After the event, we researched internet sites to report what we saw, and nuforc.org seemed like the only legitimate website we could find.Thank you.", "Chevron Shape Bright Object in the Northern SkyLooking north (Flying west) this self illuminating object caught my attention.

I then saw through the binoculars that it was a cane-shaped object spinning slowly around its own axis, with a frequency of about 1 minute.

One of the orange orbs was out ahead of the other two I would say about double the distance that the second two were apart from each other.  We talked on the phone for a minute or two as the objects disappeared into the eastern sky.  About a minute after that, two more orbs appeared following the same path, and my sister and her husband arrived at my house as I pointed out the new orbs.

At about 8:51 a single orb appeared on the same track as the other five, we watched it slowly move across the sky to the east, and it too disappeared. I would describe the light from these orbs as fire -like in that it was the color of fire and fluctuated like a bright flame, but did not trail behind like you would expect if a flame was moving across the sky.

At 9:07 PM (21:07) at the Ford Forestry Center in Alberta (L'Anse), MI, I was standing outside talking on a cell phone when I looked up to see what I suspected was a satellite.  Seeing satellites was extremely common place in Alberta, as the light pollution is very low.  As I watched the satellite, it drifted across the sky at what seemed like a much slower pace then any satellite I'd ever see had.  The object traveled roughly 1/4 of the visible sky.  As I watched, it came to a dead stop at a heading of southeast (I had a suunto compass readily available).  It then split into two separate white lights, much like stars and then re-merged together.  Not believing what I was seeing, I ran to one of my friends dorm room window and knocked on the window of one of my dorm mates.  I told her and every one else to come out and look at the star.  Her and 5 other of our class men came out and begin looking at the object, which swayed slowly back and forth, much like a pendulum.  We watched for a while until the object settled on a southeast heading and remained perfectly stationary.  We all wrote it off to our mind playing tricks on us, and it must be a normal star just flickering or giving the appearance of moving.  We all went back inside, but at this point I'd become suspicious.  Roughly an hour and a half after we first saw the object, I went back looking for it in the sky.  It had completely disappeared.  I got my friend out of her room again and she too confirmed the object where we'd been looking earlier was gone.  I did not get any pictures or videos of this happening since it was so slow in happening and I couldn't decide if I was seeing something noteworthy or average.

I looked for flashing beacon lights on the wings but there were none.  In fact, I could now tell there were no wings.  It was a simple orb.  It was traveling east northeast.  It was headed in the direction of DIA.As I continued to watch, it made a gentle turn to the southeast.  That is when I realized it was silent.  I said to myself \"What am I watching?\"  As it moved away from me, I was completely convinced that this was not a plane.

The big dipper was directly above me and I remember looking at it for about 5 minutes, not noticing anything odd, when all of a sudden one of the stars in its handle shot off at a high speed in an eastward direction, stopped, shot off again in a nothern direction and disappeared. Needless to say my neighbor and I were stunned.The thing that amazes me to this day was how well the object disguised itself. I knew the big dipper handle only has three stars but I didn't think anything of the fourth because it was spaced perfectly between two others, was sized perfectly, and was twinkling like the other stars. Nothing looked unordinary until it took off.

The sky was clear,and moonless. We witnessed a formation of three \"military fighter jets\", displaying normal navagational lights, and flying at apx. 15,000 feet on a due West heading. We clearly heard the familier sound of their engines. Trailing the formation of fighter jets (at apx. the fighter jets 8 o'clock position)was a quite large \"Chevron Shaped Object\". We were able to see shapes quite well, as the OBJECT and the Jets were being backlit by the starlight of the \"Milkey Way\". Using the fighter jets size as reference, we estimated the OBJECT size to be 100 yards from tip-to-tip of its Chevron Shape. The OBJECT had three \"white colored\" lights -- one at the apex, and one at each end(or wingtip)of the \"Chevron Shape\". The OBJECT did not display ANY OTHER navigational lights. The OBJECT matched the jets air speed and seemed to move more like a glider than a powered aircraft. The OBJECT and the jets were observable for apx. 2 minutes. My girl friend and I are very familier with the air traffic in the Tioga Pass area of Yosemite. There is a major East-West commercial air traffic corridor that follows the trace of Tioga Road (HWY 120). The steady stream of air traffic is quite familier and predictable in this area. Military flights are also quite common in this area. The flight path of the OBJECT and the three military jets we observed was south of and parallel to the commercial air corridor that follows Tioga Road. Neither one of us have ever seen an \"aircraft\" the size of the OBJECT we saw.

The lights were purely white. It looked much, much larger than a plane, I wish I could calculate the size but I cannot tell. It moved about 6 times faster than a regular airplane. It dissapeared into some hills, that was as far as I could see from my house.", "Two low-flying triangular craft with three bright lightsOn Thursday, January 29th 2003, I was driving home in a rural part of my hometown. It was almost 10 o\u2019clock, and by that time of night, the roads in the northern part of Howell Township loose most of the pulsating traffic that defines them during the day. I was heading South on Brickyard Road, and as I came to the junction at State Highway 33 (business) I could see these bright lights (six of them, three on top of three) just above the overpass of State Highway 33 (bypass; I was just near where 33 splits into the bypass and the business routes) to the south of where I was. As I crossed through the light and under the bypass, I did not really think twice about the lights. Brickyard Road becomes Fairfield road through the light. I was continuing along that way, heading south, when I noticed up ahead, through the trees, the same six lights. They were now closer, obviously. Before, I had noticed that they were in sight just over the overpass, though much further in the distance then they were now. I realized how low the lights were. As I continued to drive south, it struck me that they were heading north, straight towards me. I stopped my car and got out to look on that cold night. Again, at first I thought it was one craft with two levels of three forward facing white lights. I soon realized instead that each \"level\" as I had described it, was actually one craft. I stood and watched as they came closer, seemingly right at me. I noticed, however, that the night was extremely quiet and clear, except for the occasional cold breeze. No sound, no jet engines, no chop-chop of a helicopter. I watched as the two craft turned west as they were almost over me, gained altitude and flew parallel to route 33. It isn\u2019t really like they flew. It was more like they drifted, slowly and quietly. From behind, I could barely see them. The light seemed to be directed mostly straight ahead of the two craft. I never got a very good look at the structure of the craft themselves.", "Bright white bell shaped craft bursts into yellow and orange flames immediately dissapearing  ....at approximately 12:22am 7/18/13 thursday morning myself and 2 other witness,s  observed the strangest occurence any of us have ever seen  ...This occured/observed from lebanon,  ohio  , ...At 12:22am thursday morning we observed a bell shaped object in the sky. ...The object was white  ,,,  it glowed like the moon  ...No navigational lights  ,,, no beacon light  ,,, no engine or rotor sound what so ever  ....The bell shaped objects glow intensified a brilliant white  ....With very little motion  ,,, it made a adgile right turn and dropped altitude dimming just before a very ominious yellow and orange flame appeared engulfing the bell shaped object  ....At this very moment the bright yellow and orange flames and the craft dissapeared  ...Immediately i was checking N.W.S  to check for weather anomallies dew points and cloud cover  ....The 3 of us were very perplexed about what we had witnessed  !!!!

The craft was saucer shaped and had light panels on the bottom half of the saucer. The craft was spinning back and forth, and the only way I knew this was because I could see the light panels moving slowly back and forth. There was an inaudible hum or vibration in the air, like a subtle electric crackle. At first I thought in my mind, 'Oh wow, a UFO! So it's true...' but then I became very frightened. I jumped down off of the top of the bus and hurried inside to tell my friends, who were sleeping inside. I urged them to go outside and look, but they were too frightened to.

The skies were clear except for the wispy clouds under the contrail. At 17:35, I was scanning the skies for more contrails and pointed my binoculars almost straight up towards the east -- directly over The Colony. I could not believe what I was seeing! There were 15-20 silver spheres spread out across the sky reflecting the sun to my back! The spheres would disappear and reappear moving slowly into different patterns. I would guess these were at least at an altitude of 20-30,000 feet but that is very hard to tell. I could not make them out without binoculars. These soon disappeared and I noticed a larger white craft hovering overhead a little to my east. I focused my binoculars and watched this object for quite a while overhead then continued watching it as it slowly moved toward the area of the contrail to the northeast. It was white, reflecting the sun and appeared to have a red glow emanating from behind it at times. It then hovered again near a wisp of \"contrail cloud\" and soon after was joined one at a time by 5 spheres. These spheres (maybe 1/8 the size of the craft) slowly moved around the craft -- with very smooth and graceful moves -- as the craft moved toward the northwest. At this point they were about 6-8 miles away I would estimate and traveling slowly at about 20,000 feet. Suddenly more objects appeared around the larger craft a few at a time until there were at least 9-15 in various formations above it and to its sides. They all went out of view or disappeared at 18:35. Within 5 minutes, two large military helicopters flew overhead flying from the northeast-- the general direction of the objects.

We noticed a small cloud about 30 degrees elevation ahead of us and below it was a long grey smooth shape.  Its length was about twice the diameter of the moon.  It looked like it could have been a cylinder - or the rounded edge of a flat object.

Three dimly visible pairs of white lights. About as dim as your average star in the sky - nothing especially bright, but not so, so dim that you really have to focus to see it.I was looking almost directly upward, and then somewhat towards the west.

The eastern-most and middle craft were spaced about 1/4 to 3/8 of an inch (in terms of holding up a ruler against the sky) apart, with the western-most about 1/2 to 5/8 of an inch from the middle one. In terms of my viewpoint, they were arranged like so: top--middle----bottom - top being east, bottom being west. They flew basically northeast to southwest, possibly over the ley line labeled 8 to 16 in this picture: http://www.crystalinks.com/becker-hagensmap4.jpg   They flew at perfectly equal speeds to each other.  They were at an what I would assume was an incredible distance, as like I said, they were as dim as your average star in the night sky.  They traveled at what I would also assume was an incredibly high speed, given the distance I was viewing from. I stared for about 12-15 seconds, then turned around to look across to another apartment complex where two men were sitting on their balcony, curious if they were aware of the same thing (they weren't), and when I turned back about three seconds later, I was unable to re-spot the objects.These were absolutely not any type of stars or satellites, as there were three of them, all moving together across the sky at perfectly equal speed.They weren't human-built airplanes of any sort, as no human craft is even nearly capable of such absurdly high rates of travel.A military plane (what appeared to be a fighter jet, devoid of any flashing or bright lights [which you never see around here]) flew over at give or take three to five thousand feet in the opposite direction of the three UFOs about three to five minutes after I lost sight of them, so obviously someone at some level of authority saw the same thing I saw.I can't help but believe this is somehow connected to 10/28/11 being the end of the Mayan Tun calendar.My mind is blown.

It sparkled in a regular pattern, it seemed to me, in maybe three levels of intensity, over the space of a second or a bit less. My personal explanation is that is is a pulse-jet driven craft (Aurora?) but who knows?  Maybe it was a conventional military craft at Mach+ speeds.  I do not believe it was a meteor as it did not appear to change it's flight characteristics in any way (altitude, sparkle rhythm, brightness) and it appeared to be travelling precisely west to east.

It appeared 100-200 meters above the beach level. It was the whitest light I have ever seen.  It appeared small, diamond shaped, with a small tail.  What could have been around 1-2 football fields in length from the ground, was a sudden disapearance of the object.  It was moving at a speed that no man made object could move (I believe), being so close to the water.  I had my windows up and music lightly playing, but I heard no crash of a landing or saw no impact into the ocean or beach.  I advise someone ASAP to search the water off-shore for anything unusual.  As soon as the object disapeared, the \"check engine\" light on my car came on, but my engine did not fail to stop.  After careful thought, I ruled out the posibilities of what it could be : not an astroid/meteor, no fireworks, not a plane or a helicoptor.  I was about 30-40 miles away from camp Pendleton, but I have never heard of anything from that army base ever - EVER - leave north and become visible to any civilians.  What I saw was no hallucination, I was not under the influence of any illegal substance, was not tired, and was sober and sane.

The object began to alternate slowly between being dim and very bright.  As the object was fading intensity, the first two witnesses alerted the next 3 to the object.  As the five of us watched, two more lights, one red and one blue appeared.  The three lights moved independently of each other in sporadic and random patterns, changing in intensity for about 45 seconds before fading away.

In the South-East sky, I noticed a bright peculiar light I have never seen before in this region of the sky at this time of night/day. I have observed nighttime skies since I was a child as I have always been fascinated with astronomy. I am familiar with the difference in characteristics between observing a planet, stars, satellites and other celestial objects.The object I observed consisted of a bright, solid, white light with less intense, flickering red and blue lights. At first I thought it was just an airliner, but it was not moving in any direction.  I thought maybe it was flying towards my direction, but after 5 mins, the lights showed no changes in intensity, height or direction.I do not believe it was a star, as it did not have characteristics as such. I know for a fact it was not a planet, as Venus was high in the Southern sky and very bright.  I continued to observe the object and it appeared to make subtle motion in a back-and-forth looping pattern, but maintained it\u2019s general position.I got my binoculars to see if I could get a better view.  The object had no direction, but I could see red and blue lights flickering amongst a solid white light.  With the binoculars, I had the depth perception and believe this object was not within our atmosphere, but within the near distance of our solar system.I called my wife outside and she observed the object as well and watched through the binoculars.  She said she witnessed a single white light with flickering red and blue lights as I described.As I continued to watch through my binoculars, the object separated and became two lights moving in a horizontal direction from each other.  A few minutes later, the two lights moved back together to become one light again, with the red and blue flickering resuming.  Moments later, the light separated into two lights again and this time they moved vertically from each other.  Then they slowly moved about each other and eventually came together to become just a single light again and resumed the red and blue flickering once more.Slowly, the light began to become dimmer and appeared to get smaller as if it was moving away from the Earth.I had to go get ready for work so could not observe any longer.  I will go outside again tomorrow morning and see if the light returns.  I am not sure what it was, but it was not an object commonly seen in the night sky.", "In 1965 i was 9 years old and me and mt sister saw a fire ball craft tha looked like a acorn shaped craft somewhat like a bell with simbels on the center that looked like a figor four with three sicel moons above the four with simbels on the lower rime of the craft on the bottom it had three ports that had lighting flashing from one port to the outher.

When the evening came around, the sky was beautifully clear and blue.  I was driving, 10 and 2, and looked over my left shoulder.  I was heading West bound.  I saw something in the sky and passed it off at first.  I took another look over and it was still there.  I continued to observe it for roughly a minute.  It was stationary and I was just WAITING for it to move.  Since it wasn't moving I figured I would get my cell phone out of my pocket and video it.  I turned my head toward the road to concentrate on driving, pulled out my cell phone, turned on the camera, and the object was gone.  It was shaped sort of like a cross.  The center was more of a thin oval.  There was a small protrusion on the top of the object and a protrusion on the bottom that was about twice as long as the one on top.  It was VERY low to the ground.  Probably about 200 yards from me, and 80! -100 feet in the air.  There is little to no air traffic in this small town.

We were stationed at Submarine base Groton CT. The two of us were scared to death to say anything until now. He is not aware I have submitted this report, but I am confident he saw the same things as I did, as we talked about it both during the event and many times after.The night began after eating chow at the hall. It was not dark yet, we left the base at appx 7:00 pm. Being on foot we walked the road along the river. We soon found a spot on some rocks not far from the base right on the river. We were enjoying good weather as it was clear and warm outside. Nothing appeared to be any differnt than any other night. The sun went down darkness fell upon us. We both had taken up spots on rocks not far apart, laying down relaxing looking up at the sky.It seemed as if it was in an instance three color changing orbs appeared in the sky in a triangle formation. These orbs moved back and forth across the river in formation. They moved with the speed of light going across the river. Doing this manuver, stopping on a dime, all the time maintaining thier formation. I am not sure if thier were three or this was just one object. The whole event duration was only twenty five minutes in length. In the time frame indicated ten differnt movements across the river appearing to be looking for something. The blink of an eye they were gone disappearing in the night sky again with the speed of light.We were scared to death to talk about this or tell anyone. Fearing what might happen or people thinking we were just crazy. I know what power the goverment wields and how they deal with issues like this. Until now I never understood what they were looking for but now it is clear. The Submarine Base just down the road had in port subs. This now I am confident whatever weapons they contained was what they were looking for. News of any objects in the sky that night was not publicized nor did we ever hear of it. It has been many years but I still recall events on that night as it happened yesterday.I think someone should know about this now. It was as real as I am writting this today.

Quickly scanning the sky with my binoculars, I found three other identical objects.  The objects, which appeared as two black spheres one over the top of the other and connected by a thin short rod (simillar to a barbell stood on end), had no wings or rotors but still hovered in place. These objects were high enough in the sky that they could not be seen without binoculars.  After watching the objects for about 20 minutes, I tried shifting position in order to steady my binoculars and get a better look at the objects.

Under hypnosis I recalled the events basically beginning like this.  Seeing a huge ball of light in front of us. As if the moon had come down out of the sky.  The light was all contained within the big globe of light. It did not refract like a flashlight or other kind of light. I also recall seeing curved kind of diamond shaped different colored lights reflected either on the windshield or on the dashboard. Our car was stopped on the side of the road.  Behind our car dow! n the road there was a blue light. There were three tall figures silhouetted coming from that light toward our car. I was very upset at this point in the hypnotherapy.  Then there was a figure at the driver's window. It looked like someone with an orange monkey face.  He reached in through the open window and did something with the ignition or steering wheel. I was not upset at all about this but very calm. I recall seeing my dad either staring straight ahead in a daze or slumped over the wheel.  Then several of us (Mom from the passenger seat directly in front of me; brother a year younger; sister two years younger than me; and myself) were taken from the vehicle and led by very tall beings whom I cannot completely recall. Our baby sister was in her carseat in the back and we left her behind. She was crying. One of the beings picked up my sister 2 years younger than me. She touched it's face. I could not recall what the face looked like. A being took my hand in its hand and l! ed me out of the car. The closest I can describe the feeling o! f its ha nd is like those rubber toys that have the wires inside and how they feel when you bend them. Its fingers felt like that. Then we were inside the craft. It was sectioned like orange sections inside in crescent shapes. The floor had kind of ribbed raised strips and was like foam rubber. It was gradually curving just like an orange section would be. There was a man who was standing on the side of an entrance. He looked like a movie star. His skin color was pink but extreme pink like carnation pink. Not a natural human pink skin color. He was wearing what looked like a snowmobile suit. Then I looked again and in his place was some kind of robot or metal kind of statue with a base and a pole and top like for a head. I then saw my mother laying down. She was rubbing the right side of her head. Then I saw my brother laying down and he was also rubbing the right side of his head. I did not see my sister on board the craft. Then I was laying down. They took something and shoved it u! p my right nostril and I felt a pain like a headache on the right side of my head and I rubbed my head as well. I could not 'see' the beings standing around me very well at first. But since that time I have had more information come to me and they were what I would call \"The Whites\". Their skin is chalk white. They have big eyes like fish eyes and they have large appendages on the sides of their heads like big ears. They wear clothes which are black and shiny like the cloth is of spun shiny metal. Thinking about that cloth gives me a creepy feeling. They pulled down my pants and used a sharp object on me. During that time I thought they only touched the end of my penis with it. But since that time it has come to me that they shoved it up inside the shaft. It was a long needle. That is all I have recalled about being on the ship. I have a vague memory of being back in the car and nobody saying anything for quite some time. And dad also just driving silently for a ways before! we gradually started talking again and being I guess aware of! where w e were.", "Red and Whie flashing light over Twin CitiesI saw what appeared to be a UFO from my home in Eagan last night.  It was too far away to make out any shape, but after looking at my star software, I ruled out any planet, star or other celestial object.  It had caught my attention because it was so bright, like a bright Mars in the sky, or a tad brighter and larger.  But it was white, like a star and it was flashing red.  I needed to know what it was, but after viewing my sky astronomy software and finding nothing even closely matching, I realized it must be something else.  The object could be seen looking into the western sky at about 11:30pm, and finally going out of vision (very small spec by this time but the flashing red still visable) at about 2:00am, traveling very slowly in a west-ward direction.  I grabbed my camcorder to see if I could zoom in any closer on this object.  While I did record the flashing red, you can't make out anything else.

In the days after the events of 9/11/02 I knew the skies were empty of civilian traffic so I thought I would keep my eyes open for possibly any military traffic. After not seeing anything on the night of 9/11/02. I stopped over a friends house the following evening (9/12/02) and after talking about it we headed outside at approximately 20:00 to 20:10 hours the skies were completely clear with quite a few stars and by luck within a few minutes of heading outside we both at the same time sighted (2) two lights moving in tandem with the southern light trailing the northern light at a distance of about one inch in relation to a thumb and forefinger of an out-stretched hand, I approximated them to be at orbital heights and speeds moving from East to West. I immediatley considered them to be satellites due to their speed and brightness but thought it was odd that they were traveling in such close proximity to each other and at that instance the trailing southern light grew much brighter almost blueish in intensity than the northern light and suddenly burst ahead of the northern light. Following this, the northern light also grew brighter and jumped ahead of the southern light,this occured at about the 1 o'clock position and as they crossed to about the 2 o'clock position they both began a counter clockwise spiral rotation around each other as if they were playing follow the leader. We first picked up the objects up at approximately the 11 o'clock position and followed them through to just past the 2 o'clock position before loosing them in the light pollution of our city. The entire time my friend and I were calling out to each other verifying what we each were seeing to be sure we were really seeing these objects and I specifically recall the excitment from both of us when the spiral maneuvers began. I am an aircraft mechanic and a longtime aerospace/aircraft buff and have been employed by NASA since the mid 1990's, so I consider myself to be somewhat knowledgeable regarding aircraft/aerospace and I have on many occasions located, tracked and viewed various satellites and the Intermational Space Station this is why I had determined the objects to be of a orbital height and speed in relation to the time it was taking them to cross the night sky. During the entire duration of this event there was no detectable noise and at the estimated heights it was impossible to determine if there was any type of shape associated with the two lights.", "bright flash, occurs every other night for about 2 weeks, still happeningbright flash, occurs every other night for about 2 weeks, still happening- a few military vehicles passed through here yesterday", "3 seen, 1 Orange globe coming from north, made sharp turn to east.

Then it hid behind a cloud that was passing by and started to fly west behind the cloud.Then it went on a zig-zag pattern to the north then headed east once again.   All this time it was flying at the same speed and was occasionally shining a white light.As it went to far east I lost sight of it.

Maybe they're satellites, I don't know, but they are there.  On this particular night, I was watching one of these star things when out of nowhere appear these two orange, dimly lit lights, traveling northwest in a parallel orientation. They were moving very fast, but were only visible for a few moments, then they were gone.  They were real. I saw them with my own two eyes.  What the hell is up there?", "White light particle beam with small ball-like head moving silently over Post Falls IdahoI saw a UFO in the southern sky.  It was traveling from east to West. I was standing on my front porch looking at a constellation and suddenly I saw what first appeared to be a meteor but was traveling not as fast as a meteor--it resembled more a white particle beam with a white head on it.

We live in the country and the sky was quite clear.  My dad noticed two bright objects above our vehicle and asked everyone else in the vehicle what they were.  I turned the vehicle around to try and get a better look.  At this time ( driving north)  the two lights took off  farther ahead of us and about 2 - 3 hundred yard up.  The two lights were reddish orange and flew through the sky at the same distance of each other.  After following the lights for about 5 - 10 minutes the first bright light completely stopped.  The second light caught up to the first one and they joined together.   The one light started flying east and higher in the sky.  After they joined and started moving, the light completely disappeared. There were five adults who witnessed this in the vehicle.

I saw dull yellow object ascend rapidly into the skyline above the mountain.  It was in the distance (across the other side of the mountain) but it was larger than any aircraft I've ever seen. Steady light, no blinking and no sound.  I immediately ceased my phone call to watch it because I was stunned by what I was seeing and very confused.  It hovered over the mountain in my line of sight but it was much lower than any normal flight paths.  At first it shot up and hovered for a few seconds, then it shot rapidly to the left in a straight line. It moved so quickly that the light left a small pattern in the sky behind it for a split second (probably just my eyes adjusting).  Then it stopped completely and was still for another second or two.  Then it shot again to the left just as fast as before in the same straight line across the horizon.  And then it zigzagged rapidly downward, angled to the right.  It stopped again.  Then it zigzagged rapidly downward, angled to the left again. In this last zigzag, it descended below my line of vision behind the mountain.  No noise. No leftover lights.  It just disappeared. About two minutes later, I noticed two aircraft (small blinking lights, normal looking) flying in that area and they also disappeared behind the mountain after another minute or so.It's hard to describe the orb/ball I saw.  Again, it looked like a dull yellow but it was also very  bright at the same time (or, at least, very big).  It did not brighten up the sky around it from what I could see. It was across the mountain but from where I was positioned, it had risen just enough for me to see it over the tree-line of English Mountain.I've never seen anything like this before.

The light was cast between the branches of a Red Pine, and I couldn't help but to stare at it. The rays coming off the light made it look like a snowflake I first counted 7 rays beaming from it but as I continued to stare I was able to count 12.  I was fascinated alone with its brightness, but then it dissapeared; so I thought. I moved my head and was able to see it again from my new vantage point, and that's when it hit me... stars don't move.So I moved to the middle of my yard for a better view through the clear moonless sky, and I noticed there were more lights with the others much more distant.  As I gazed at the lights I could see they were subtly moving side to side, up and down and in small circles.  Usually the movements were slow which caused me to second guess whether or not they were actually moving but then the larger closer light moved erratically to the right and then up, before back down and left to its starting point.  I called my fiance to come outside and she saw it move as well, but wasn't as convinced as I was.I called a friend up and he couldn't see it from his place so he drove to my house and we watched it for a good 5-10 minutes before it made a large movement like previously described. He freaked out and drove home, this isn't anything either of us would have dreamed we would witness.  We were both hesitant to call it what we both thought it was, a ufo, but now I am convinced.There were also several &quot;shooting stars&quot; near these lights throughout the course of observation.

As we came closer we watched as it turned as if on an axis at a 90 degree turn towards the east. I had rolled my window down to get a clearer look and noticed it made no sound. In excitement we turned into that parking lot as we did so it began moving laterally eastward. We began to follow it, it moved slowly at first, but suddenly accelerated rapidly.

They would disappear and then reappear in a different location.One object seemed to be in the shape of a dome on top. I saw one, then two and three. There were most usually two.

I was using a digital camera and when I took the picture of the large configuration, my camera went totally black except for the normal information readout. I have never had this happen before. I tried repetedly to take a picture and it just wouldn't work. Even the viewfinder was black. I had to turn it off and then turn it on again.

Since I live very close to the area, I will be personally doing a field investigation for a small UfoAmerica.iwarp.com. Several thousand others were witness to this event, as vehicles on surrounding roadways were reportedly pulling off to the shoulder faster than you could imagine.

The event was reported on all the local NJ/NYC news channels including Fox-5, NBC-4, WB-11, NJ-12, and is totally unexplained. The orbs moved about, changing various formations. People said they saw everything from a circle, to the big dipper. The UFOs were just floating there in the sky, moving about each other and taking various formations. Carteret NJ police were notified by several callers. So far there has been no radar confirmation, and it appears that the military was not involved. The only alternative explanation at this point, are unlawful sky divers with illumination flares. However, the length of the event seems to rule that out. There are at least two known videos. The UFOs themselves were of the \"string of pearls\" variety. The same type have been caught on tape before. Once in the US in the 50s I beleive, and the other in Mexico more recently. This seems to be a very good sighting with many people as witnesses. I will be going door to door today asking witnesses to tell their story in the area.

Turning slightly right atop the 50 yard incline of Cliffside, now on South Drive, I heard children playing and spotted them above the church as I walked toward bustling Fort Henry Drive.  I couldn't help but wonder why children would play on such a dangerously steep driveway slope.

Tap, tap my stick rings my advance up the steep drive between RHA and the Seventh Day Church drives.  Coming to my usual flat rock,facing South, I habitually stand both feet together while staring down into the craggy boulders beneath, craning to see any life scurrying about.  As I look up the tree at about 10-12 feet  I am aware of the slight dusk- breeze and the sudden break in traffic noise. Suddenly, I am staring straight at an elongated shiny \"craft\" resembling a two-piece telescope,with two distinctly different colors of metal, patchwork assembled like bricks, with opposing flat panels mid section about an eighth the width of total craft length.  The schock of its silence, ghostily speeding near mach 1 was mezmerising, I stepped back, leaned on my walking stick as the object glinted on the left mid side, then right mid side before glinting out about 3 inches above the mountain peak behind Wal-Mart. I was coherent enough to judge the objects scale as 6-8 times the diameter of the Sun, level, and wondered if 20 tractor-trailers! could fill its mass.I stared at nothingness for another 30-40! seconds before traffic noise pulled me toward home, completely avoiding my normal walk route.  My walk this night, a bit unusual, I could not wait to draw out what I'd just witnessed.

Basically I was driving north from O'neil towards Spencer on HWY 281 in Nebraska and I was watching the sky because there was a storm in the distance to the northwest of me and clear skies north and east of me.  When suddenly I noticed lights north of me just to the east side of the hwy.  The lights were clearly above the horizon in the sky.  It seemed like they might have been moving independently then they came together in a horizontal row of 4 lights and were evenly spaced aprart.  The cluster appeared to be hovering.  Then they began to move, but the cluster as a whole stayed in the same place.  The light on the right side of the row of 4 lights stayed stationary the entire time and the other 3 began to scroll toward the stationary light.  It was like the lights were on something round and it was rotating right so the lights were still evenly spaced and moving toward the stationary light.  When a light came close! to the stationary light it would dissapear and a new light would appear on the left side of the 4 lights.  It scrolled like this 5-10 seconds or so.  Then the outside 2 lights stayed stationary.  So between the 2 stationary lights from the left to right a light would scroll toward the one stationary light on the right side and it would dissapear when it reached the light and a new one would come out from the stationary one on the left move over the the stationary light on the right again.  It did this 5-10 seconds or so and I went to grab my camera and just before I turned it on they all just went out and I never saw them again.  It was strange.  I've never seen anything I couldn't explain before so this was a first.  I am curious if anyone else reported anything.", "An amber colored light appeared on the horizon and moved slowly, in a very straight line, East to West.Seen from my backyard, while watching new year's fireworks.  An amber colored light appeared on the horizon and moved towards us, until it was directly overhead (my house obscured the view after that).  It moved slowly, in a very straight line, East to West.  At its closest, I viewed it through binoculars and could only see a flickering amber light (almost like fire).  There were no blinking lights to indicate it was a commercial aircraft.  The speed was similar to that of a commercial jet, but the light was far too large for a plane at that height. It did not seem to make any sound.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

( Hwy 98 ) , I pulled over at the cable company by the big Christian Church . It was about 10:30 p.m. I noticed something moving towards the East in the sky .  I thought with tourist season in effect that it was a helicoptor but it was strange to see one at night and at back beach road . As it got closer , I noticed it was not a helicoptor , I had no clue what it was . It was dark in color , almost transparent with the exception of 3 reddish lights , one on each corner but very dim . It was about 100-150 feet above the ground , and not a sound what so ever . Several vehicles pulled over to witness this , I had a disposible camera and took the whole roll full of pictures , but all I got was black pictures back when they were developed . No TV news reported it , I called the police and was told several calls had come in but no one knew what this was . To this day it still baffles me .

Oregon.My friend and I were hunting out in the desert about 100 miles south of Burns Junction, when just at dusk I saw what were extrememly large Chevron shaped amber/orange glowing lights all in sink, shaped into a \"V\" (but a horizontal V), approximatley 20 miles away and each one was about the size of the moon.  I yelled for my buddy to hur ry up and come look, and within that time, 2 of the lights, one by one, went out, then they came back on. Then a few minutes later, all of them went out.  About 10-15 seconds went by, and the 5 lights reappeared again, however, this time they were about 100 miles away and the lights looked about half the size of the moon.  Then they all disappeared at once and we never saw it again.  There was no sound whatsoever during any of this, and normally, with how close, we should have heard some type of sound from it, butbeing out in the middle of nowhere, you could hear very well, and we heard no sound at all from this aircraft.  We were extremely weirded out by it as we have NEVER in our lives seen anything remotely like this.  Even my buddy who is a retired Federal Agent - and neither of us feel this was any aircraft from here, unless some type of undisclosed govermental experiment as it was just too large and eary.  We are truly perplexed by this.  We got a little worried and decided we should pack up early and get out of the area and go home.I am a Developer in the construction business, age 54 My buddy, a Retired Federal Agent, age 63  Did anyone in the Southeast Region of Oregon see anything similar to this around this this date/time?((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The time of the event is approximate - it may have been an hour or more later. I spotted the object to the northwest of my Renton location in the direction of downtown Seattle.My first impression of the dark object was that it was perhaps a dirigible in place to observe fireworks displays, but if it was something the size of a dirigible it would have to be at an altitude at which dirigibles are not normally seen.  My curiosity piqued, I grabbed my binoculars to get a better look. What I observed for the next five minutes or so was simply puzzling. The shape was similar to a blimp but rounded on each end - an egg shape that is elongated somewhat on its horizontal axis. The color was dark , there were no appendages. I wondered what I was seeing as the thing drifted slowly to the south , apparently wind born. Only once did the thing seem as if it could possibly be under some control when the larger end turned into the wind, but that motion would be consistent with the action of the wind on its shape. I took particular notice of an odd coloration on the smaller end a couple of minutes into the observation when it was about due west. Might this have been a reflection of the sunset?  At any rate I lost the object when I moved to the front of my building. It was then to the southwest. My impression was that the object was three to eight feet in length.   I didn't call the sighting in because it seemed to be some very odd type of balloon.  It turned in the wind as a balloon would. The similarity in appearance of the object to that shown on your website was so great that that I deemed it noteworthy, especially if there were other observers.", "Orange object flying north to south for few minutes a little faster than aircraft and split in two east to west at incredibly fast rate of speed and disappeared.", "Strange objects in the sky ove Alto, GA.On Friday, June 12th, 2009 I and my girlfriend witness something in Alto, Ga.

After about ten minutes a group of planes appeared and 2 of the objects broke off and came directly towards us.

It had a metallic appearance with lights located around the bottom along the edge, these lights were between purple and blue in color and there was also a pulsating yellowish light located between the round bottom of the craft and its round domed top. I looked at it for several seconds trying to make out what I was seeing before I tapped my boyfriend and said do you see that, I should mention that I have never believed in aliens, or bigfoot or anything of the sort I am a graduate student majoring in forensic science and have always been taught there is an explanation for everything, he looked up got quiet for a few seconds and said \"oh my god, what the hell is that.\" We continued to drive north and the craft simply hovered there, the night was clear and silent and we both noticed that whatever it was it emitted no noise, we continued driving and the object began to travel north but at a slow pace. My boyfriend began to feel uneasy about this round object which was most definitely not a plane or a helicopter or any other flying object either of us had ever seen before and turned right, at this point we were traveling east but were still looking back at the odject, maybe 4-5 minutes had passed by this point. Now we had to look back and to the left to keep the object in focus, at this point the object began to tavel in our direction rather rapidly however it was now slightly tilted with the bottom turned toward us, the closer it got the larger it appeared and the more detail we could make out (at this point the object was only about 2 blocks from us,) we co! uld not understand how those around us could not see this, it was so close, but the drivers around us did not appear to be looking in the direction of this craft which could easily be seen by looking through the back seat window on the driver's side but rather straight ahead.  At this point the craft was traveling behind a set of buildings, once again I commented on how low it was, it wasn't flying over the buildings but behind them so that its view would be blocked for about half a second everytime it went behind a building,( the buildings were apartments I estimate to be about 15-20 stories high)the object suddenly took off in the opposite direction and we lost sight of it.", "we were laying down looking at the stars... what seemed like 2 stars were stationary for a good moment.. then started moving apart from each other with the same speed.

It occurred after I heard a strange noise coming from my driveway.  As soon as i was done investigating the sound i turned around and that is when I saw the white light.

These lights that I have seen all seem to disappear when nearby planes or helicopters pass the area, and the lights flare back up, sort of like these lights are in hiding.  It is awesome to see.  A few times I have noticed these orbs flare brightly and change colors from white to red, blue, yellow, sometimes they look like fire.From my vantage point along Highway 308 in Mathews, south of Highway 90 and the Gheens road, looking north, it seems that these ufos that I have been seeing are coming from the woods/marsh area that lies between Gheens road, Highway 90, and Lake Des Allemands.  They always tend to start there and slowly hover towards the vast area of sugarcane fields north of Gheens road, but south of Highway 90.This all happens at night, usually starting around 10pm till 4:00am.

I was near a small private airport in Baldwin WI watching several loads of jumpers deploy from 11,000 ft. agl when I noted the bright light about 45 degrees above horizon and bearing about 240 degrees from Baldwin.  This object DID NOT MOVE over an hour and one half of repeated observations. I called this in to your people and also called the nearest FAA Flight Service station in Princeton MN.  I do not know what this was but it was like a star visible at noontime !  There were no clouds.  I am certain the object was well above 11,000 feet agl since the jump planes were clearly below it in altitude when jumpers deployed.

It never moved.((NUFORC Note:  During the telephoned report from Wisconsin, we explored the possibility that the object witnessed might have been the planet, Venus.

Definitely was not a plane or helicopter because it didn't move for 1 hour.  Not a tower because it was over the Gulf of Mexico and I don't think it was a satellite, because it was flashing distinct red and green lights and I do not believe satellites look like that in the sky.Did anyone happen to see this recently as well?", "3  large orange teardrop shaped lights over Santa MariaAt 7:45 PM I took my dogs outside to urinate.  Noticed a large bright orange teardrop shaped UFO.  It made an audible grinding noise when it moved, but there was no noise when it was still.  The underside of the UFO appeared to be green.  It also had an aura around it.  It was coming twords my house.  It the distance, I saw a round orange ball with an aura around it going in the opposite direction.  (Moving south of Vandenburg.)  I called for my husband to come outside.  By that time, the orange ball was gone and the orange teardrop was moving away from us and getting smaller, looking like a ball.  Then out of nowhere, another bright orange teardrop UFO shot up into the sky.  By this time I was on the phone with the police department asking if anyone else had called in about these sightings.  (They said \"no\")  We watched as the second UFO was out of sight and the third, follow in the same path of moving twords the house, hovering a few times, then moving away from the house going south, turning into a ball with an aura around it and vanishing out of sight.  It was CRAZY!

PD))", "Object with row of 6 or 7 lights, moving in sky with non-linear changes of speed and direction.I looked up into the sky and saw an object moving around, appearing as a row of 6 or 7 lights across what I would say was the front of it.  This appeared to be one object \u2013 not 6 or 7 objects.  I got the impression it could have been round, but could only see it as a row or line of lights.  The lights were usually white, sometimes there would be a red light or two that would appear, and then vanish.  At times it appeared the lights were rotating, but there was no consistent pattern.  The moon was bright in the sky and even though there was a very thin layer of haze from clouds, for the most part the sky appeared clear.  It was possible to see the stars through the haze.Size of the object was difficult to estimate.  The \u201cfront\u201d of the object appeared to be similar to what the length of a typical commercial passenger jet would be at that same position in the sky.What caught my attention the most was the way the object was moving \u2013 up, down, side to side, back and forth, fast, slow, doing \u201cturns on a dime\u201d, and having such sudden acceleration to \u201chop\u201d around the sky while it was changing its direction.  Sometimes it was moving fast, other times slower.  No conventional aircraft \u2013 plane (jet or not), blimp, or helicopter \u2013 could have done these maneuvers, especially at speed.  It displayed varying rates of speed, which were not linear, and it did not matter whether it was climbing, turning, etc.  There was no correlation of direction of movement to change of speed.  It certainly wasn\u2019t a balloon, either.  The area of the sky in which it appeared is just west of the usual flight path of jets, yet there were no aircraft in the area that I could see until right before it disappeared.I have lived near military bases and airports and have never seen aircraft do these types of maneuvers.  I did attempt to video the object but there was too much ambient light for it to show up.", "Driving home at night, saw lights that I thought were landing lights of an airplane, stopped my car, lights didn't move, huge object.Driving home from town, I observed what I thought were landing lights from Air Force planes.  I lived within probally a mile or so of the landing pattern for Seymour Johnson AFB and have seen their planes numerous times. Also, my father was career Air Force and I have been around planes all of my life. To the point that I was able to identify certain types of planes just by hearing them, the distinct sounds they made. (Ex. F4's, C5A, C141's, F104 & 105's to name a few) This particular evening I was about a mile from home, when I noticed \"these\" lights.  Being familiar with the area and what SJ landing pattern was, when I saw these lights, I thought to myself , \"these guys are really low\".  I watched for about 30-45 seconds.  The lights appeared right at tree top level.  The closer I got to the lights, the lower the seemed to drop, now visibly seeing trees pass in front of these lights, evern at a distance. My thought at that point was, these guys are not going to make the runway.  From where I lived and where I saw these light and knowing where the runway was, they were just too low.  The runway was at least another mile to the east and they were at tree top level.  The first part of the road I was traveling on a straight away.  After about 30-45 seconds of watching this, the road turns to the right. No one on the roads at all that night. As I bear to the right towards my home, which is about 1/4 mile away now, I am now looking to my left, out of the drivers window, watching these light, which seem to bop from tree top level to below that and back up again.  At this point, I am really thinking that this plane is going to crash, these guys are in trouble and they are way too low.  Again, after I bear right and I'm watching what I thought was an Air Force plane, I'm only going about 20 mph, hardly taking my eyes off of this thing.  Also, there is a small wheat field off to my left on the other side of the road before the tree line. The tree line at this point where I am at is about 220-250 yards from the! road. As I'm watching this thing, I use the term \"thing or lights\", I notice something strange which at first I concluded was just some kind of optical illusion, because of the direction I am traveling now and the direction of the lights are traveling. I think SJ planes usually land in a west to easterly direction. I am now traveling west. As I'm driving, I'm glancing out of my window, the lights look like they are going in the same direction I am traveling.  I have my window down in the car as well, and after 150 or so feet, I begin thinking to myself, I should be hearing this thing as large as it is and it's seems to be going the same direction as me, this is really strange. So I pull my car to a stop. A complete stop in the middle of the road. I look out of my window and there slightly below tree top level is this huge craft of some type, now also, like me, stopped, not making a sound, no engine sound whatsoever, not moving, but clearly airborne and clearly a very large craft.  My best estimates on size were 300 ft long and about 40 foot high, multiple row of lights straight across for looked like each tier, three tiers. Anyway, I panicked after about 6-7 seconds of sitting there looking at this thing, punched the gas and flew home. I have had 2 other encounters/observations/sightings, one the very next night, at my house which was stange in itself and another about 10 years earlier when I lived in Alaska. The Alaska sighting I had was witnessed with a friend, whom I won't mention.", "Seeing a light over Black Mesa.The night sky was clear and the moon was about a quarter full, so you could see the stars. At first, I did not notice it until my dog started barking towards Black Mesa. I tried to tell get him to stop barking, but he would not. So I looked towards where he was barking and he was barking at a light that was top of Black Mesa. It seemed like it was nothing and then all the dogs in the area starting barking too. So I kept watching the light along with the dogs. Then my dad came out of the house to see why the dogs were barking. So I told him they where barking at the light over Black Mesa. It was shaped like a oval, light. The color of the light was white in the center, and around it was two other colors yellow and lite blue. The colors seemed to virbate bright and then dimed back and forth. It was floating on top of Black Mesa very slowly for about 15 to 20 minutes. It started from the east side of the mesa, going west. I did not see were it went, but it was gone. Then I just went back inside with my dad.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I looked up at them from my parked car and in a few moments they both disapeared like lights shutting off.  I drove forward, I don't know, I wanted to follow them, the one on the left appeared again like someone turned the light back on.  This one lasted just for a couple of seconds then disapeared.  It was a very clear night, and was nearly a full moon.  As soon as I saw the second light go out I looked at the clock in my car and it read 9:54pm  I backed up back to my driveway and ran into the house to tell my husband what I saw.  The lights were sphere shaped and almost had a halo of light going through the center of them.  They were very bright and very large.  They had no noise.  At 10:02 we heard what sounded like jet noises.  Like airforce jets make.  We looked and looked and did not see any jets.  I received a phone call from my sister in-law and was telling her what had just happed.  The telephone started making noise like she had hit a bunch of numbers or re-dial.  I got mad at her because I thought she was making fun of me.  I then gave the phone to my husband because I did not want to talk to her if she was going to make fun of me and later she and he both said the same thing happened on the phone with them too.  The phone conversation was fairly short.  I then spoke to my brother & other sister in-law about it ( on the phone) and shortly thereafter decided to call the local radio station.  A man answered and I asked him if anyone had reported any strange lights around the bay that evening.  He said no in a funny tone so I said thanks and no more.  My husband and I decided to surf the net to see if we could find anything (this was about 15 min after the last conversation with my brother) and the computer was acting funny.  Things were not transmitting properly.  We were having a hard time getting the mouse cursor to stay where we put it.  I kept moving back down o! n it's o wn if we moved it up.  We gave up on trying to search anymore on the net.  I live less than half a block to the end of the bay.  The lights were high up and standing still.
